            <h1>A Different Kind of Intervention</h1>

            <h2>Why is it different?</h2>

            <p>Since we <strong>don’t have all the answers</strong> about how to hustle with your phone, we need to crowdsource them.</p>

            <p><strong>What does crowdsource mean?</strong> When you crowdsource something, you find a solution by drawing from a lot of ideas from a lot of people. The “crowd” of people gives you your answer.</p>

            <p>Since we want to see a <strong>progression in the learning curve</strong>, we want to make this intervention a bit different and invite participants people to feel like they have reached a level good enough to teach each others. For example, participants should feel like they can teach their community how to leverage the potential of their smartphone after the intervention.</p>

            <h2>What is the new format?</h2>

            <p>Instead of teaching specific content, we will invite participants to reflect and find their own solution.>/p>

            <p>We are designing a workshop which invites people to be creative and to collaborate.</p>

            <p>While we are inviting participants to find their own solutions, <strong>we will provide a lot of helpful materials, processes, and advice</strong> to them so they don’t feel overwhelmed at first.</p>

            <h2>What are the deliverables?</h2>

            <p>Each [participant/group/site] will leave with a list of tips, lessons, examples and ideas about how to hustle with your phone, how to make your life more productive, and how to use the smartphone to find solutions to your problems. THE FULL POTENTIAL.</p>

            <p>We will combine that list into a final curriculum that we can then publish.</p>

            <h1>Icebreaker &amp; Team-building</h1>
            <div class="time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Materials needed:</p>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>An idea for an ice breaker</li>
              <li>Facilitation needed: Everyone. 1 person lead the icebreaker.</li>
              <li>Documentation needed: Observe the atmosphere, write down notes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Split everyone up into teams of ±4 people</p>

            <p>Each team should have a Mozillian or DDD staff with them: they will be facilitators and note takers.</p>

            <p>Do an ice-breaker.</p>

            <p>Come up with a great name, and a short motto/poem/song/chant.</p>

            <p><strong>Facilitation needed:</strong> 1 Mozillian per team helps and observe.</p>

            <p><strong>Documentation needed:</strong> Document the behaviors, answers and questions.</p>

            <p>Each team will work together to come up with creative ways to use their phone, through a few challenges given by the DSO team and other ideas coming from their team work. Example for these challenges can come from this survey.</p>

            <ul class="fancy">

            </ul>

            <p>When discussing each challenges, the teams should use the following template that will help them analyse the way that they could use their smartphones:</p>

            <h2>TEMPLATE CARD</h2>

            <h3><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Using online maps</h3>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>What is it?</li>
              <li>Who in this group has already used online maps?</li>
              <li>Answer:....</li>
              <li>Who can explain what a map is? What about an online map?</li>

              <li>Do you know how they work?</li>
              <li><strong>A tip:</strong> You can insert the definition of a map here.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Observations</h2>

            <p>Each participant will look at Google map and play with it a little bit to understand what it is.</p>

            <p>Help and questions as needed</p>

            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>

            <p>Each participant come up with an idea of how they can use it in their lives. The facilitator takes notes:</p>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li><strong>Participant 1:</strong> I can use it to.... It’s useful because....</li>
              <li><strong>Participant 2:</strong> I can use it to.... It’s useful because....</li>
              <li><strong>Participant 3:</strong> I can use it to.... It’s useful because....</li>
              <li>Etc.</li>

              <p><strong>Facilitation needed:</strong> 1 Mozillian per team helps and observe.</p>

              <p><strong>Documentation needed:</strong> Document the behaviors, answers and questions.</p>

              <p>Each participant will give a common life problem challenge and then the team will work on solving them creatively with the web or their phone.</p>

              <p>Encourage exploration and using different aspects of the phone.</p>

              <h2>TEMPLATE CARD - PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>

              <h3>Problems to Solve</h3>

              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> A challenge or problem I sometimes face is....</p>

                <li>What do you need to make it work?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Participants should think through the skills they need to use this solution (example: reading a map, manipulating a map, saving a location etc.).</p>

              <p>Repeat for other participants on additional card templates.</p>
