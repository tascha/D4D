        <h4>Content Choices</h4>
        <p>Content priorities were developed through findings from the needs assessment and consultation with local organizations. Pilot testing was conducted to obtain feedback on the relative amount of time allocated to different topic areas. Examples and case studies are largely relevant for the Myanmar context and can be replaced with locally relevant materials as needed. Examples of additional modules that could be created include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gender sensitive data approaches</li>
            <li>Ethics and privacy in the data lifecycle</li>
            <li>A module specific for managers</li>
            <li>Program-specific skills (e.g. Excel, R, SPSS, Tableau)</li>
            <li>Proxy indicators</li>
            <li>Basic data and computer literacy</li>
            <li>Basic statistical literacy</li>
            <li>Big data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As noted above, the curriculum was designed to be adaptable for new content to be added and topic emphasis shifted based upon new target audiences.

        <h4>Key Organizations</h4>
        <p>The curriculum was developed by the Technology & Social Change Group at the University of Washington Information School, in partnership with the Myanmar Book Aid and Preservation Foundation. The project was made possible by the generous support of the Tableau Foundation. An initiative led by the employees of Tableau Software, the Tableau Foundation encourages the use of facts and analytical reasoning to solve the world’s problems though fellowships that help non-profits build data capabilities from the grassroots up.</p>

        <h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>
        <p>Improving ways to create meaningful, locally relevant resources that bring more voices into the decision-making process requires understanding nuance. This work cannot be done well without collaborative insight. If you have any feedback on the curriculum or suggestions, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
