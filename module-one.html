          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>
          <p>Begin by greeting the class and introducing yourself. Provide time to discuss your background, any experience you have with data, and any other relevant information you wish to share.</p>  

<p>Outline the structure of the day (two modules with a break in between for lunch), and provide time to address any other administrative issues that need to be brought up before class begins.</p> 

<p>Pause to ask if anyone has questions so far.</p>

            <h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
            <p>Next, introduce the name of the workshop, taking time to write “Data for Decision Making” on the whiteboard (if possible). Underscore the word “data”, or verbally highlight it.</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Ask the class to work with a partner and take a moment and think about what they think of when they hear the word “data”.  Have the class write down 5 words that they associate with data. If they are having trouble thinking of words, feel free to gently guide them by providing a few words: numbers, words, etc. If you provide this information, ask the participants not to use these words as their answers.  (5 minutes) </li>

              <li>Ask for volunteers to report back on what they wrote. If possible, write their answers on the board. What did they write? Did some people write similar answers as others? Do people agree with other people’s answers? Discuss their answers with the class. (5 minutes) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before transitioning, make sure to underscore to the participants that we are going to jump right in and define “data”, “decision making”, and “data for decision making” and then outline course goals and objectives.</p>
 
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

            <p class="summary">Note to instructor: This section comes before describing the workshop to provide context for the workshop.<p> 

            <p>After that the class has shared with each other what they think data are and what they associate data with, offer a formal definition. On the board, write 
            <ul>
              <li>Data: 
                  At its most basic level, data are collections of facts and information. This information can come be packaged as numbers, words, measurements, observations, or descriptions.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>An example:</p> 
            <p>If I didn’t eat breakfast and am hungry, I could ask my colleagues where the best place to get Mohinga is nearby. When I ask that question and receive responses, I collect information. Try to solicit the type of information collected from the class. Is it price? How the breakfast tastes? How close the breakfast place is to the office? How long it will take to eat the breakfast?</p> 

            <p>The information that I collected can be considered data.</p> 


            <p>Questions to ask:</p> 
            <p>Now that data have be re-framed to simply be information, ask the class what kinds of data (information) they collect in their everyday life. If the class is quiet and has not provided a response, feel free to nudge them along with a few more examples, such as do they ask their families about their days when they get home? If they want to buy a new cell phone, do they ask for recommendations?</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Decision Making: 
                After collecting data (information), you are free to make a decision. When you make a decision, you can use the data you collected as evidence to make an informed decision.</li> 
              </ul>
            <p>For instance, in the previous breakfast example, if you hadn’t asked your colleagues for their suggestions for breakfast options, you run the risk of eating a bad breakfast. When you collect data from your colleagues, you can use that information (their response) as a solution to your problem (the fact that you are hungry) in order to make an informed decision that leads to a great breakfast.</p>

            <p>The more people you ask, the more data (information) you have in which to make your decision.</p>  

            <p>Questions to ask:</p>
            <p>Take some time to relate this information back to the participants’ own lives. Ask the class how they’ve used data to make their informed decisions in their own lives. As some guiding questions, ask would they rather have a good breakfast or a poor one? If you want to buy a new cell phone, would you rather take your chances on getting a phone that seems like a great choice, only to realize later it doesn’t suit your needs? Gathering information and using it to make an informed decision is a fact of life that may happen on a daily basis for many people.</p> 

            <p>Once the discussion has finished, Underscore that data are information that is all around us, and that we are all willing or unwilling consumers of data.</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Putting it all together: Data-driven decision-making is the practice of basing decision on the analysis of data rather than using your intuition, guess, or estimate.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Take a moment to ask the class why they think it is important to base decisions on evidence.</p>

            <p>Once finished, relate data-driven decision making back to organizations or local governments, saying that using data to make these decisions allows us to improve programs, respond more effectively to organization and community needs,create solutions to pre-existing problems in organizations or communities, and allows the public to use data to make decisions as well.</p> 


            <p>Take a moment to answer any questions from the participants. Then, transition by mentioning that with this greater context and understand of data for decision making, we can move on to , the goals and outcomes for this workshop.</p>

            <h1>Defining Workshop Goals and Outcomes</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Goals:</p> 
            <p>The goal of this 3 day workshop is to equip you with ability to understand issues and resources around data and data collection, and learn the importance of using the data to make an informed, evidence-based decision. This workshop is meant to help you and your organization better understand, use, and manage data for decision making.</p> 


            <p>Outcomes:</p> 
            <p>By then end of this workshop you will be able to:</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Use a basic set of processes and questions to assess the data environment at your own organization.</li> 

              <li>Critically examine data visualization approaches for different audiences.</li> 

              <li>Understand data lifecycle theory, basic skills when working with data, and the resources needed to support working with data.</li>

              <li>Be able to create a data project plan that is specific to your own organization.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Take a moment to walk the participants through the structure of the course. Each day will be structured as two, three hour workshops with a one hour break for lunch in between that focus on addressing key outcomes and goals.<p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Day 1: Introduction to Data for Decision Making (morning), Assessing your own organization's data culture (afternoon)</li>
              <li>Day 2: Building data skills and resources</li>
              <li>Day 3: An applied project using your new skills in which you will use the data available to you to solve a problem or assess a need at your organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pause before moving on and allow time for the participants to ask any clarifying questions.</p> 


          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Case Study</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <!--<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7500/15717291089_4ddcb34737.jpg" alt="An image of a wall with an ad painted on it for an internet cafe" width="90%"></p>-->

            <p>Provide context for the participants about how decisions made with data can lead to innovative, evidence based practices for organizations and governments.  Take a moment to introduce the following case study to the participants, and provide context.</p> 

            <p>Guiding questions before beginning: How can data be used to solve a problem?</p> 
            <p>Are there any examples of governments using data to make decisions that the participants can think of?</p> 
            <p>What about organizations that use data to make decisions?</p>


            <p>Many countries around the world are using data to make decision on a daily basis, and are seeking ways to solve existing problems using new forms of data.</p> 

            <p>As a prior to beginning the case study, provide context by briefly outlining the case study below in Armenia (adapted from UNDP, A guide to Data Innovation for Development, 2016).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Armenia, Tourism has great potential for growth. Commonly used data sources such as hotel booking logs and border control records are expensive and time-consuming to collect, and only provide part of the picture.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP office in Armenia saw an opportunity to help the tourism industry by using a new form of data collection: understanding tourist preferences by analyzing the number of roaming foreign SIM cards in use.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP team in Armenia used this new form of data collection to track origin and travel patterns for tourists in Armenia, and could then share the data with government decision-makers and local businesses to understand and adapt to shifting tourism trends.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Discussion Questions:</p> 
            <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Armenia was trying to solve? How did they use data collection to solve i How did they use new data to solve the problem? How can they now use that data to make a decision?</p>  

            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Case (MIMU):</p></b>
            <p>Provide context by briefly outlining the case study from Myanmar Information Management Unit’s (MIMU) use of cell phone data and GPS coordinates to create and update baseline data on schools across Myanmar:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Myanmar, smartphones have become increasingly accessible and popular since foreign investors entered the country in 2014. Most individuals now have a smartphone and a data-enabled SIM card.</li>
              <li>MIMU wanted an easier and more accurate way to compile and update baseline data on school locations across Myanmar. Data collection where individuals visit each school and mark the location is time consuming and costly. Accurate and up-to-date baseline data are important to developing more sector-specific data. Information regarding the number and location of schools is also important to help communities identify where available schools are, which schools close, and where more schools are needed. In 2015, MIMU decided to utilize the growth of cell phones and mobile data to facilitate baseline data collection on schools. This was cost effectively, fast, and would allow for data to be collected and updated more frequently.</li>
              <li>They created the “School Location Collector” tool, which collects the GPS location of schools. School officials use the service to get the GPS location and save it to the system’s database. They can then send the GPS coordinates over the internet or by SMS.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>Now, allow each participant the time to read the following case study. On their own, have them write down their answers to the following questions on a sheet of paper:</p> 
              <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Colombia was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it?</p> 
              <p>How can they now use that data for decision making?</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

                <p>Ask participants to find a partner. Each partner will interview the other and ask</p>

                <ul style="background-color:#c3e0ee;">
                  <li>What did you learn today? What big ideas will you take with you?</li>
                  <li>How do you think information moves on the Internet and cellular network? What do you see in your mind when you think about information traveling between phones and other devices?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Give pairs about 10 minutes to complete their interviews.</p>

                <p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1494/26435629630_ecc46fb9b5.jpg" alt="An image of two workshop participants looking at a device together" width="90%"></p>

                <p>After 10 minutes, ask each partner to grab some paper and markers and to illustrate - however they want - one of their partner's answers. That means each group member should illustrate either what their partner learned or how their partner described the Internet or cellular network.</p>

                <p>Then give participants about 20 minutes to finish their illustrations.</p>

                <p>Finally, have each participant reintroduce their partner to the group and explain what they learned using the illustration as a prop. After each person has introduce their partner and shared their learning, encourage group members to share any other ideas or questions they have with the group.</p>

              </li> <!-- end of step-->

                  <li>
                    <h1>Installing and Using Smartphone Apps</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">60 minutes</div>

                    <p><strong><em>Facilitation tip:</em></strong> this is an hour where participants can benefit from in-depth mentoring and explanation from the team to install mobile applications and better understand their devices and the internet. It is therefore a unique opportunity to learn about people’s challenges, and discover what interests them. Be a good listener, and be on the look-out for apps that people ask you about.</p>

                    <p>The Google Play Store is the place to look for Android apps with your learners. The smartphone icon for the Play Store looks like this:</p>

                    <p><img src="images/play-store-icon-1.png" width="25%" alt="An image of the Google Play Store icon"></p>

                    <p>Help your participants install apps and answer questions they have about them. To get srarted, gather participants into small groups, with one facilitator per group. Ask questions like:</p>

                    <ul style="background-color:#c3e0ee;">
                      <li>Do you know how to install applications?</li>
                      <li>What applications are you interested in?</li>
                      <li>What is the latest app you have downloaded?</li>
                      <li>What are things people need to know when downloading apps?</li>
                      <li>Spend time with each participant to answer their questions and install mobile applications they are curious about.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It's also a good idea to think aloud as you help them work with apps so they can create mental models of what's happening. While helping participants install apps, try to understand the following points:</p>

                    <ul style="background-color:#c3e0ee;">
                     <li>Do participants know what an app store is?</li>
                     <li>Do participants know how to search within it?</li>
                     <li>What apps are interesting for participants?</li>
