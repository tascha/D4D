            <h2>Data for Decision-Making Curriculum</h2>
            <p>The overarching goal of the Data for Decision-Making Curriculum is to build the capabilities of research organizations, government ministries, and civil society organizations to more effectively collect, use, and share data in their organizations and apply data in their decision-making processes. Through basic organizational data environment assessment, understanding each stage of the data lifecycle, and tools to develop a data project plan, the curriculum aims to increase the awareness and use of quality data for evidence-based decision-making and in tackling social challenges.</p> 
            <p>You can <a href="https://tascha.github.io/D4D/curriculum/">view the curriculum online</a> or <a href="https://tascha.github.io/D4D/downloads/">download each curriculum component</a>.</p>
            <h4>The Gap</h4>
            <p>The curriculum was developed in response to the results  of a needs assessment conducted by Myanmar’s Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation. The assessment, which spanned multiple government ministries and civil society organizations, indicated an overwhelming desire for tools to support the changing organizational data environments across sectors in Myanmar.</p>
            <p>Although there are many data literacy resources available, there was not anything that fit the precise needs of organizations in Myanmar. Specifically:
                <ul>
                    <li>A structure designed for environments with nascent/emerging data cultures</li>
                    <li>A comprehensive approach that begins with the foundations of assessing organizational data environments and data problems, upon which skills can be built</li>
                    <li>Not focused solely on statistical skill building</li>
                    <li>Open and customizable</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>We see these as needs not unique to Myanmar and have structured the curriculum to be adapted and expanded for other locations.</p>
        
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <p>The key objectives of this course include:

            <h4>Curriculum Structure</h4>
            <p>The course is structured into three days spanning six separate modules. Each module has a specific goal and covers a topic designed to bolster ability in using data for decision-making. Modules are structured over a three-hour period including one ten-minute break. Each module contains new information while simultaneously building on previous knowledge from past modules. While following these modules in order can provide the user with a solid foundation in data for decision making, the modules are meant to stand alone and can be applied in whichever order the user chooses.</p>
