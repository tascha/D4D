## Improving agricultural yields through data innovation
UNDP, A Guide to Data Innovation for Development (2016)

Climate change is increasingly threatening agriculture around the world, including in Egypt, where the UNDP office set out to address the problem through data, in collaboration with the Faculty of Computers and Information at Cairo University. 
The Challenge to farmers, and the lack of data, comes from unexpected shifts in rainfall and planting seasons. Most agricultural producers reply on historic data, which are increasingly unreliable in a shifting climate. But data innovation is offering a new tool. 

The team knew that in Colombia, for example, a team of researchers and a local industry organization were able to create a new predictive weather model for rice farmers. The team used multiple data sources: 
- Annual rice surveys
- Harvest monitoring data
- Experiments on rice sowing dates 
- Weather data 

Using these data, the researchers indemnified geographically specific relationships between climate and agricultural yields. The tool they created successfully forecast a drought, and helped 170 million farmers in Colombia avoid an estimated 3.6 million loss during the drought. 

Following the previous experience from the Colombia research, the team in Egypt identified new sources of data that could be used within their own country. They established two sources: data from the sensors network for the Central Laboratory for Agricultural Climate, and the local and international weather station data, a combination that (Based on previous successes) proved to reveal insights for decision makers in the area of water management. 

This example is a hypothetical situation of how data could be used for decision making in Myanmar:

Natural disasters in Myanmar threaten both crop production and populations in affected areas. Both the cyclone in 2008 and the excessive flooding in 2015 resulted in many deaths, displaced persons, and crop and paddy destruction. The new parliament is working to create new policies to address concerns following future natural disasters. They want to understand if crops and export potential or the displacement of local populations are affected more by these natural disasters. In order to do so, they need to draw from several data sources to evaluate the effect of natural disasters on crop production and on local populations:

- Annual rice surveys
- Monthly exports
- Weather data
- National population data and UN data on internally displaced persons

Using these data, politicians can use past weather data and data from UN agencies to determine which townships were most affected by the cyclone in 2008 and the rainfall and flooding in 2015. They can then analyze the population data published yearly by the Central Statistical Organization to identify if there was a significant population decrease in these townships and increases in neighboring townships. They can also use the population data to identify if populations returned to the affected areas by observing any growth in affected townships. The politicians can then identify if the UN data on internally displaced persons aligns with the affected townships. To evaluate the effect on crop production, politicians can use annual rice surveys to identify any decreases in rice production in the states and regions with affected townships. The politicians can also identify if rice production remained low in these areas in following years, which would indicate more permanent damage to crop fields. They can also use data on the amount of rice exported and changes in the price of rice to identify the effect of natural disasters on the nation’s economy. To identify if natural disasters in Myanmar have a larger effect on populations or crop production, politicians can then compare their findings. In this situation, data collection and sharing are instrumental in helping individuals make informed decisions.
