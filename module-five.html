          <p>Welcome the participants back. Spend a few moments going over any administrative tasks if necessary. Then, outline the structure of today. In the first half of the day, participants will be reviewing the concepts they have learned over the past two days, and will apply these concepts to a data project in order to solve a problem at their own organization using the new skills that they learned. Then, after lunch, the participants will use the remaining time to finish their projects and then present them..</p>

            <p>Next, take a few moments to review the following key concepts from yesterday. Project this image on the screen:</p> 
            <p><img src="http://tascha.github.io/D4DM/images/data-lifecycle.jpg" alt="Data Lifecycle Chart: Collect, Analyze, Share" width="100%"></p>
            <p>Ask the class about the data lifecycle. How would they describe:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collecting data</li>
              <li>Analyzing data</li>
              <li>Sharing data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As they describe the concepts, have them discuss different aspects of each step in the cycle. For instance, with regards to collecting data, what necessary steps are there?</p>
            <p>For the collection phase, review:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primary data</li>
              <li>Secondary data</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Why is data sharing important?</li>
              <li>Possible digital open formats for sharing (.xls, comma/tab delimited, .doc, .xlsx, .PDF, .JPEG, etc)</li>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p>
            <p><i>From <a href="Datatherapy.org">Datatherapy.org</a>, Accessed May 2017</i></p>
            <p>A key component of data visualization is knowing how to tell a story. In data visualization, there are often just a limited number of “key” pieces of information that you want to convey to your target audience. This could be trends that you as an analyst noticed, or outliers that should be given special attention. Using a visualization turns this information into something that is quickly and easily digested by people who may not understand the relationships that you found in the data just by looking at a summary table.</p>

            <p>Any dataset has the potential for multiple stories to be told. Picking the most appropriate story based on your audience and goals is hard. In this activity, participants will be broken into a minimum of five groups, with at least two or three people per group. Each group will be provided a sample dataset that is relevant for their country and copies of one of the five following story-type worksheets. Each participant in the group should complete a worksheet.</p> 

            <p>Next, each group should share their completed worksheets internally and choose one to develop into an actual story narrative. This activity builds capacity to turn “dry” information into a compelling story. It also reinforces the link between data presentation storytelling.</p> 

            <p>Next, groups will present their work to the class. After each presentation, lead a Q&A discussion with the participants. Some guiding questions include: would this story resonate with our target audience? Is this story a complete picture of the data we have? What makes this story compelling? How could it be made more compelling? Is this the most important story to tell at this moment in time? Is there anything important missing from the story that needs to be provided for context? Can this story be misinterpreted in any ways?</p> 

            <p><b>Developing a Story - Factoid Stories</b></p>
            <p><i>Adapted from <a href="Datatherapy.org">Datatherapy.org</a></i></p>
            <p><b>Directions: There are many different things that you can communicate with your data. Using the dataset provided and the following guiding statements, develop each piece of a data story. When finished, share your story with your small group. Your group should then choose one story to develop into a more complete narrative to share with the class.</b></p>
            <p>Often a dataset will contain one specific piece of information (a “factoid”) that you want to pull out and make understood by your audience. This information could be an outlier that has a significant difference from the rest of the data, or it could be something important that is common across the entire dataset. In addition to helping make an important detail understood, this can serve as an entry to help your audience understand more (and potentially more complex) parts of the data.</p>
            <p>Complete the following:</p>
            <p>One interesting factoid is</p>
            <p>This stands out from the rest of the data because</p>
            <p>It is important to tell this story because</p>
            
            <p><b>Developing a Story - Interaction Stories</b></p>
            <p><i>Adapted from <a href="Datatherapy.org">Datatherapy.org</a></i></p>
            <p><b>Directions: There are many different things that you can communicate with your data. Using the dataset provided and the following guiding statements, develop each piece of a data story. When finished, share your story with your small group. Your group should then choose one story to develop into a more complete narrative to share with the class.</b></p>
            <p>One important story that can be told is the interaction between parts of your data. Recall from previous discussions the term “correlation”, which describes a relationship between two or more variables. If one goes up, so does another. Or if one goes down, another other goes up. It does not, however, mean that one variable impacts the other or “causes” the other to change. Although the reasons for the interaction can take time to discover (likely more time than is available during this session), awareness of the correlation can nonetheless be important.</p>
            <p>Complete the following:</p>
            <p>The two (or more) pieces of the data that interact are</p>
            <p>The nature of their interaction is</p>
            <p>It is important to tell this story because</p>
            
            
            <p><b>Developing a Story - Comparison Stories</b></p>
            <p><i>Adapted from <a href="Datatherapy.org">Datatherapy.org</a></i></p>
            <p><b>Directions: There are many different things that you can communicate with your data.

Your group should then choose one story to develop into a more complete narrative to share with the class.</b></p>
            <p>Different pieces of your data can be important to compare to describe and draw out key similarities or differences. This comparison story is composed of smaller stories. Why is the story in one part of your data different than that of another? Or how does one small story show a larger story for the entire dataset?</p>
            <p>Complete the following:</p>
            <p>The data we want to compare are</p>
            <p>Comparing these data shows that</p>

            <p>It is common for our minds to focus on how things change over time. Creating a story that shows change resonates with our natural curiosity and is important for understanding our data.</p>
            <p>Complete the following:</p>

                <h1>Reviewing Key Concepts</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

                <p>Review the following key concepts with the participants. This could be done by playing a review game where the class is split into teams and has to answer questions about each concept, or could be done by a simple instructor-led review. For each concept, be sure to spend time with the participants and have them describe each term’s significance in data for decision making.</p> 
                <p>Again, as before, try to have the participants provide their own definitions before</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data</li>
                  <li>Data for decision making</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Ask, what are the key steps to using data for decision making? Remind the participants:</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify a problem or research question</li>
                  <li>Assess data available to you and your data needs</li>
                  <li>Identify stakeholders</li>
                  <li>Plan for how data will be used, analyze, and shared</li>
                </ul>

                
              </li> <!-- end of step-->

                  <li>
                    <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                    <p>The following are ways that data can be applied. Similar to the format above, pause and ask the class for definitions of each word before providing the definitions in this instructor’s guide.</p> 

                    <p>Dataset: Data selected and arranged in rows and columns. Has the class seen datasets before? What does their datasets look like? How are these datasets stored?</p>  

                    <p>Take time to pass around several sample datasets. In groups of 2-3, have the participants look at each dataset. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p> 

                    <p>Documentation: documents that provide proof or evidence of something, or are a record of something. What are some examples of documentation in the participants’ everyday lives? If the class is quiet, feel free to provide some sample answers (i.e. a passport, birth certificate, proof of residency, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Data visualization: a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.</p> 


                    <p>Pass around example visualized charts or project these images on the screen: </p>

                    <p>For each visualization, ask the class What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p>

                    <p>Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in something. For example, who are the stakeholders in this class? Who are the stakeholders at a restaurant? Who are the stakeholders at a football match? </p>

                      <li>Data visualization print-outs</li>
                      <li>Datasets printed out for participants</li>
                      <li>Data visualizations</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p> 

                    <p>Remind the class that data visualization is a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization.</p> 

                    <p>Pass around this image, or show it on the screen</p>

                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic1.png" alt="An image of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic2.png" alt="A zoom-in of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Only allow each person to look at information for 30 seconds. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p> 

                    <p>Now show the class the same dataset, but visualized:</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic3.png" alt="A map visualization" width="100%"></p>

                    <p>Allow the class 30 seconds once more. Now, have them answer: What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p>

                    <p>Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data are easier than looking at datasets or report. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.</p>

                    <p>Visualizing data allows us to help you or the person using your data easily understand your results and quick pull out information that is relevant to them.</p> 

                    <p>Now ask the class, how would they visualize these data for different stakeholders. How would they visualize it for those working in the employment bureau? What about that work at an NGO? How would the public want to view these data?</p>

                    <p>In this activity, the participants will be broken into groups of 2-3. They will each be given a data visualization. Working together, they should answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the data that were used to make this visualization? It is not provided, so think critically about what information was used to make the chart.</li> 
                      <li>Who is the intended audience, or audiences that could use it?</li>
                      <li>How could they frame these data a different stakeholder? For example, if their answer to the above question was the government, how should these data be visualized for the public?</li> 
                      <li>What problem are these data visualization trying to show?</li> 
                      <li>What information can you gather from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>What conclusions could you make from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>Using the conclusions you made, what are additional questions that you could as about the information provided in the data visualization?</li> 
                      <li>What kinds of decisions could be made from them?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the class is finished, have each group present their findings to class. When the presentations are over, debrief with the participants. You might ask the following questions:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Did you like one visualization more than the other?</li> 
                      <li>How can you use data visualizations to make insightful conclusions?</li>
                      <li>How can you use these conclusions to make decisions?</li> 
                      <li>How can these decisions improving programming within communities or organizations?</li> 
                      <li>What should you consider when visualized data for the public, the government, or an NGO?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It’s important to discuss with that class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>good data visualizations require good data. If the data that underlie a visualization are faulty, the result will be misleading and incorrect conclusions from the visualization.</li> 
                      <li>The processes described in Activity 1.1 of defining a data problem, audience, and goal, are also necessary to take for visualizations. As we move forward throughout this class, we’ll return to these topics. It’s always critically important to remember that for every data project, you need to keep in mind the your audience and what you are trying to accomplish with the data.</li>
                    </ul> 
 
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b></p> 

                    <p>For more advanced classes, use the following questions for participants to answer in their presentations:</p>  

                    <p>What other data could be provided to make this more meaningful?</p>
                    <ul>	
                      <li>Different percentages? Total populations? Other...</li>
                      <li>Why do we want to tell this</li>
                      <li>Is there anything misleading or easily misinterpreted?</li>
                      <li>What other information is necessary for context?</li>
                      <li>What assumptions are made about the graph?</li>
                      <li>Date</li>
                      <li>Comparisons provided matter</li>
                      <li>Data quality/completeness</li>
                      <li>Other</li>
                    </ul>

                   </li> <!-- end of step-->
