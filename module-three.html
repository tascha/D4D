          <h1>Review</h1>
          <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
          <p>Welcome the participants back. Remind the participants of the structure for today: two, three-hour workshops with a break in between for lunch. Also use this time to go over any administrative tasks as necessary.</p>  
          <p>Then, review the following key concepts with the participants. Again, as before, try to have the participants provide their own definitions before</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Data</li>
              <li>Data for decision making</li>
              <li>Stakeholders</li>
              <li>Assessment</li>

              <li>Data producer</li>
              <li>Data consumer</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Ask, what are the key steps to using data for decision making? Remind the participants:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify a problem or research question</li>
              <li>Assess data available to you and your data needs</li>
              <li>Identify stakeholders</li>
              <li>Plan for how data will be used, analyze, and shared</li>
            </ul>
            
          
          <p>Pause to ask if anyone has questions so far.</p>

            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts: Data Lifecycle</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
            <p>Write the word “lifecycle” on the board or project it on the screen. Ask the class what they think the word means. Where have they seen this word before? What kind of examples of lifecycles can they provide? If the class is quiet or slow to respond, feel free to provide some guiding questions, such as what is an example of a lifecycle within their own life? An animal’s life? A plant’s life?</p>
            <p>Tell the class that much like living things, data has a lifecycle of its own.</p>
            <p>Project this image on the screen, or pass it around to participants.</p>
            <p><img src="http://tascha.github.io/D4DM/images/data-lifecycle.jpg" alt="Data Lifecycle Chart: Collect, Analyze, Share" width="100%"></p>
            <p>Then, tell the class that this image represents a data life cycle. There are three stages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collecting data</li>
              <li>Analyzing data</li>
              <li>Sharing data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remind the class that any data lifecycle always begins with a research question or problem that you are trying to solve.</p>
            <p>Then, move on to the following definitions. As before, solicit the class for their own definitions before providing them with the ones below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data collection: data collection is the process of gathering information in a systematic way. Collected data are generally intended to answer questions and/or evaluate outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remind the class that data can be collected from surveys, questionnaires, interviews, or observations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzing data: data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and visualizing data with the goal of discovering its useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. (Wikipedia)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Take time to explain to the participants that data analysis is made up of many stages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Inspecting the data</li>
              <li>Cleaning the data</li>
              <li>Transforming the data</li>
              <li>Visualizing the data (visually)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Introduce the above concepts, but make note that will be explained in detail in the next module. Then, provide the definition for the last part of the data lifecycle: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data sharing: data sharing is the process of making data that are used in problem solving, research, or evaluation available to others. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Underscore to the participants the importance of sharing data. Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues around the world have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered to be key parts of research. In addition to the data themselves, metadata and documentation should also be shared if possible.</p>
 
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Providing Context</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <p>Provide context by going through these steps in a country specific example and a generic example.</p>
            <p>Below, two examples have been provided of applications of the data lifecycle. One is a generic example, and one is a country specific example for Myanmar. If implanting this curriculum outside of Myanmar, it would be helpful to provided participants with data lifecycle examples in their own countries.</p>
            <p><b>Generic Example: Digital Green, India</b></p>
            <p>The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in agricultural services is becoming increasingly common. These technologies—which include radio, SMS, television, video, and Internet services—have the potential to help smallholder farmers increase their incomes by making it easier for them to learn about and adopt new farming methods, grow higher-value crops, or connect with new markets.</p>
            <p>Digital Green, an international non-profit organization based in India, uses locally-produced videos and in-person facilitation to share knowledge about improved agricultural and nutrition practices. The program aims to help rural communities across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa understand and adopt better agricultural and nutrition practices, and the ultimate goal of the program is to have a positive impact on individual well-being. Digital Green is currently working in nine states in India, and also in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Tanzania, Malawi, and Papua New Guinea. Since its start in 2008, Digital Green’s program has produced over 4,000 videos reaching more than 800,000 viewers across more than 9,000 villages.</p>
            <p>Digital Green is in the process of measuring the program’s impact on farmer livelihoods and health status using evaluations in both India and Ethiopia and its effect on improving nutrition-related behaviors in India. The organization has also invested in an activity monitoring system that reports data on program implementation and tracks the adoption of Digital Green-promoted practices from remote locations. One challenge in the activity monitoring system is its reliance on data from partner organizations, which varies in quality. Recognizing the issue, Digital Green has instituted a series of data quality checks and procedures to improve quality. The Goldilocks Initiative’s recommendations for Digital Green focus on its agricultural activities, and include refining and consolidating the program’s theory of change and conducting a systematic review of data quality. (<i>Innovations for Poverty Action Lab, 2016</i>)</p>
            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Example: MIMU 3W</b></p>
            <p>In 2008, after Cyclone Nargis, the Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU) launched their 3W project to track and share humanitarian and development activities undertaken by all agencies across Myanmar.</p>
            <p>3W stands for “Who does What, Where.” By keeping an up to date database on which organizations (who) are conducting certain activities (what) in Myanmar (where), other organizations and donors can better target beneficiaries to ensure humanitarian and development needs are met.</p>
            <p>The partnered agencies share their information on planned, ongoing, and recently completed activities every six months using standard sector definitions and MIMU compiles these data. They clean and digitize the data, creating quality baseline data sets on humanitarian and development efforts in Myanmar and on responding agencies in the country. They then make the data publically available for other agencies to use. The intended impact is that agencies and donors can use these data to determine which areas, sectors, and populations to target in their future projects. (<a href="http://themimu.info/3w-maps-and-reports"><i>http://themimu.info/3w-maps-and-reports</i></a>)</p>
            <p>After each example, take time for discussion with the participants regarding data life cycles. Some guiding discussion questions include: What was the problem the organization was trying to solve? How did the organization collect data? How did they plan to analyze data? How will the use data to make a decision? How can the organization share their data? How does the organization question their data quality? Can all the data be shared openly? What kinds of issues need to be considered if data are or are not shared?</p>

            <h1>Understanding Data Collection Methods</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Transition with the participants by saying that now they have a deeper understanding of the data collection as a whole, the next part of the module will focus on data collection processes, protocols, and concepts.</p> 

            <p>Review with the class what primary and secondary data are. Solicit answers from the class. Then, provide them with the following simplified definitions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primary data: information collected by you or your team.</li>
              <li>Secondary data: information that is collected by a third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Take time to discuss with the class the benefits and drawbacks of each kind of data. Primary data are valuable in that you have control over the collection of the data and direct knowledge of the data have been managed. But they are more costly and time consuming. And certain expertise is needed for data collection design.</p> 
            <p>Take the time to walk the class through the different forms of primary research.</p>

            <p>Then, state that secondary data are also valuable because they can improve your insights, help plan new data collection, or answer existing questions without having to spend time and money collecting data. Walk the class through different sources of secondary data, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Journals</li>
              <li>Books</li>
              <li>Newspapers</li>
              <li>Records</li>
              <li>Previous reports and analyses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ask the class for examples of primary and secondary data at their own organizations. If they collection primary data, what were the benefits of that? What were the disadvantages? What about the benefits and disadvantages of using secondary data for a project?</p>
            <p>Underscore to the class that in many cases it is valuable to use a combination of both secondary and primary resources in making a decision with data.</p>
            
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>A key part of any data collection plan are data collection protocols. Ask the class what a protocol is. Once they have provided their own definitions, ask the class what they think a data collection protocol might be. Then, provide the following definitions: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protocols are systematic plans for how a set of operations are to be carried out
</li> 
              <li>Data protocols are systematic plan for how data are to be collected, stored, and described</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Data collection protocols can help save time and resources by specifying the format the data should be collected in, the types of data you want to generate, the instruments you will use to generate and collect data, and how it should be stored, and how it should be shared.</p>
            <p>Introduce the concept of “metadata” to the participants. Solicit the participants for their own definition of metadata, then provide the following</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Metadata: information that describes, explains, or gives context for other data. They are provided to make it easier to interpret, use, and manage data.</li>
              
            </ul>
            <p>Metadata are important because they are used to add context to data. Metadata are the key for primary data to be used as secondary data. Metadata can be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Descriptive metadata (Such as who created the data, what was the data created for, where was the data collected, and when the data was collected)</li>
              <li>Administrative metadata (Why these data were collected)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ask the group for examples of metadata.</p>


          </li> <!-- end of step-->

              <li>
                <h1>Key Considerations in Designing a Data Collection Plan</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                <p>There are key questions that should be considered when designing any data management plan. Walk through the below questions with the class:</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li><p>What questions are trying to be answered?</p>
<p>The first step to collecting data is to clearly understand the problem. Write down a set of questions and potential ways they can be answered with new or existing data.</p></li>
                   <li><p>What do you need to know?</p>
<p>Often when we list the kinds of data we want it can become a wishlist of things that are all “interesting” but may not all be necessary. Make sure everything in your list of “need-to-know” data are necessary for answering the questions or problem you stated. Go back and forth between the data and problems to make sure both match. You may need to remove some data from your wish list if they do not support the problem statements. You may also need to revise your problem statements if the data you list do not support what is there but you feel those data are vital.</p></li>
                  <li><p>When to collect new data (primary), and when to use existing data (secondary)?</p>
<p>This can be answered by exploring existing data sources, writing down explicit questions to be asked and trying to answer those with existing data sources, etc.</p></li>
                  <li><p>What instruments will you need to create?</p>
<p>Collecting new primary data requires significant time developing new instruments, making sure the questions are phrased accurately to get the data you need, and testing them before administering them.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Who will be involved in data collection, and for how long?</p>
<p>Plan to have people involved that can contribute data collection and analysis stages.</p></li>
                  <li><p>What documentation will be needed to use the data again?</p>
<p>This should tell the history of the data. Who created it? When was it created? Why was it created? What information does it include?</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Project the steps of the data collection plan process on the screen or pass it around to the participants.  State that this can help provide a helpful guide in the future when designing data collection protocols. Walk through the steps with the participants, taking time for discussion. If possible, have a student volunteer a problem they would like to see solved with data from the “telephone” activity. Then, walk through the steps with the class. Pause and answer any questions.</p> 

              </li> <!-- end of step-->

                    <h1>Providing Future Resources</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

                    <p>The following section of this module provides participants with sample resources surrounding data management and collection that they can return to in the future. If using a projector, take time to go to each website and click around, providing commentary with participants about the website’s purpose and how they can use the website in the future. If not, provide screenshots of each source that can be passed around to the participants as the instructor describes each data resource.</p> 

                    <p>Sample resources:</p>

                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p> 

                    <p>Google Forms are free and openly accessible digital tools that can be used to design a survey. For our benefit, many of these tools work together – so we can use Forms to collect data, and we can use Sheets to view aggregated data.</p> 

                    <p>In this example, we are going to design a simple survey for the sake of collecting data about people’s experience attending a movie. We want to understand what is typical of their experience.</p>
                    <p>Surveys are a valuable instrument for collecting data when doing evaluation, gathering information about an unknown subject, or generally understanding users behaviors. Some additional features that make for a good survey are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The population is known, and can be separated (differentiated) in some meaningful way, such as by</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Age</li>
                        <li>Gender</li>
                        <li>Income level</li>
                        <li>Education level</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>You have a small set of questions that you want each participant to supply</li>
                      <li>The questions you want answered are simple, and have straightforward answers</li>
                      <li>The responses might vary by the type of participant</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Survey questions can take a variety of forms – the most common types of questions that can be asked are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Multiple choice -  participants choose from a set of examples</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>When asking many multiple choice, or check-box questions, you can also use a “grid” format to ask many questions in a row. We will look at an example of this in our first exercise.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Rank order - participants are asked to rank a set of options</li>
                      <li>Likert scale – a participant is able to offer a judgement based on a numerical value (e.g. 1 being the best, and 5 being the worst)</li>
                      <li>Open ended or Short answers – a participant is given the opportunity to, in their own words, respond with an explanation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To create a new google form</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Log into your Google Drive account</li>
                      <li>Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms">https://docs.google.com/forms</a></li>
                      <li>We can either create a new form, or select an existing template</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the first exercise, let’s select the “Exit Ticket” template</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Here we see an example of a form that allows participants to leave Short Answer responses about their experience in a class.</li>
                      <li>Notice that in designing the form you can click on an individual question</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>This gives you the option to change the type of question that is being asked, edit the text of the question.</li>
                        <li>You can also select whether the question is “Required” meaning it has to be answered by each participant, delete, or duplicate the question. </li>
                        <li>To move questions around in order, simply drag the 6 dots at the top of the question</li>

                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic2.png" alt="A zoom-in of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Only allow each person to look at information for 30 seconds. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p> 

                    <p>Now show the class the same dataset, but visualized:</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic3.png" alt="A map visualization" width="100%"></p>

                    <p>Allow the class 30 seconds once more. Now, have them answer: What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p>

                    <p>Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data are easier than looking at datasets or report. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.</p>

                    <p>Visualizing data allows us to help you or the person using your data easily understand your results and quick pull out information that is relevant to them.</p> 

                    <p>Now ask the class, how would they visualize these data for different stakeholders. How would they visualize it for those working in the employment bureau? What about that work at an NGO? How would the public want to view these data?</p>

                    <p>In this activity, the participants will be broken into groups of 2-3. They will each be given a data visualization. Working together, they should answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the data that were used to make this visualization? It is not provided, so think critically about what information was used to make the chart.</li> 
                      <li>Who is the intended audience, or audiences that could use it?</li>
                      <li>How could they frame these data a different stakeholder? For example, if their answer to the above question was the government, how should these data be visualized for the public?</li> 
                      <li>What problem are these data visualization trying to show?</li> 
                      <li>What information can you gather from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>What conclusions could you make from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>Using the conclusions you made, what are additional questions that you could as about the information provided in the data visualization?</li> 
                      <li>What kinds of decisions could be made from them?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the class is finished, have each group present their findings to class. When the presentations are over, debrief with the participants. You might ask the following questions:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Did you like one visualization more than the other?</li> 
                      <li>How can you use data visualizations to make insightful conclusions?</li>
                      <li>How can you use these conclusions to make decisions?</li> 
                      <li>How can these decisions improving programming within communities or organizations?</li> 
                      <li>What should you consider when visualized data for the public, the government, or an NGO?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It’s important to discuss with that class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>good data visualizations require good data. If the data that underlie a visualization are faulty, the result will be misleading and incorrect conclusions from the visualization.</li> 
                      <li>The processes described in Activity 1.1 of defining a data problem, audience, and goal, are also necessary to take for visualizations. As we move forward throughout this class, we’ll return to these topics. It’s always critically important to remember that for every data project, you need to keep in mind the your audience and what you are trying to accomplish with the data.</li>
                    </ul> 
 
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b></p> 

                    <p>For more advanced classes, use the following questions for participants to answer in their presentations:</p>  

                    <p>What other data could be provided to make this more meaningful?</p>
                    <ul>	
                      <li>Different percentages? Total populations? Other...</li>
                      <li>Why do we want to tell this</li>
                      <li>Is there anything misleading or easily misinterpreted?</li>
                      <li>What other information is necessary for context?</li>
                      <li>What assumptions are made about the graph?</li>
                      <li>Date</li>
                      <li>Comparisons provided matter</li>
                      <li>Data quality/completeness</li>
                      <li>Other</li>
                    </ul>
