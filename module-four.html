            <p><b>Materials Needed:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paper</li>
              <li>Pencils</li>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p>

            <p>This activity focuses on data reliability, question asking, and combining different data sources. Introduce the dataset to the class by projecting it on the screen and go over its contents together. What information is in the data set? What could be part of its metadata?</p>
            <p>Then, pass out copies of the dataset and put the participants into groups of 2-3. Have the participants inspect the dataset and answer the following questions on their pieces of paper:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the most interesting question you want to ask the dataset you are looking at?</li>
              <li>Do you need any other datasets to answer this question?</li>
              <li>How could you get the other data you need to answer this question?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Afterwards, provide a space for discussion and debrief surround the activity. Questions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are all the answers to your questions contained in the dataset?</li>
              <li>Where are the data from? If the sources of the data aren’t revealed, you should be skeptical.</li>
              <li>Do you see places where values are missing? Mission values are one way data can be “messy.” If the class is unfamiliar with the term “messy data”, take the time to define it.</li>
              <li>The data that was given to class is aggregated summary data, but sometimes you can ask interesting questions about just one row in a dataset, or look for an “outlier”. Are there any “outliers” in the dataset? If the class Is unfamiliar with “outliers”, provide a definition for them.</li>
            </ul>
 
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Reintroduce the following image to the participants by passing it around or projecting it on the screen.</p>
            <p><img src="http://tascha.github.io/D4DM/images/data-lifecycle.jpg" alt="Data Lifecycle Chart: Collect, Analyze, Share" width="100%"></p>
            <p>After collecting your data (Module 3), you unfortunately don’t have a brilliant flash of insight and understand how to solve the problem or answer your original question. In order to make meaning out of your data, you need to analyze your data, which is the next step in the data lifecycle after data collection.</p>
            <p>Remind the class of the following definition for data analysis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data analysis: data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and visualizing data with the goal of discovering its useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. (Wikipedia)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following are steps to follow in beginning any data analysis.</p> 
            <ol>
              <li>Choosing method for analysis. </li>
              <ul>
                <li>This can be thought of as making meaning of the data, or how you will use the data to answer your question or solve your problem.</li>
                <li>We want to choose a method that helps us answer our question or our overall goal.</li>
                <li>If we want to know, for example, which parties are most represented in state and region parliaments? To answer this we need election results data (including location information), and we probably want to produce this on a map.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Preparing data for analysis</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The next step is to prepare your data for analysis. Often, “raw data” straight from surveys, sensor data, or voter data can be “messy”, meaning it is not ready for analysis. To fix this, you often need to “clean” your data. Ask the participants what they think data cleaning might be. Then, provide the following definition:</li>
                <li>Data Cleaning means making sure that data are ready for analysis.</li>
                <li>Data cleaning depends on data type, and the method of analysis. In general, we should consider whether or not they are ready for analysis (e.g. are the values standard?) We can do an initial check on the data by picking some random values, and comparing them. We can also begin to “sort” the data by looking for minimum and maximum values, lists of values. If possible, use a dataset to demonstrate how to sort your data in excel or Google sheets</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Data Normalization</li>
              <ul>
                <li>After cleaning, the next step is data normalization, which means making all values consistent.</li>
                <li>This includes ‘0’ vs ‘NA’, using similar scales, using similar decimal points, dates, words, etc. For location data, we also want to initially make sure that all of our data are within the right map and all locations are uniformly named.</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
              

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Understanding How to Make Meaning Out of Your Data – Descriptive Statistics</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

            <p>Now that the data have been prepared, cleaned, and normalized, the next steps in data analysis are to make meaning out of our data by applying the method of analysis that has already been chosen in order to reach a conclusion. In many ways this is finding and accepting (or rejecting) an answer to our question.</p> 
            <p>We will cover three ways of making meaning with data in this workshop:</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Descriptive Statistics</li> 
              <li>Coding qualitative data</li> 
              <li>Visualization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>First, we’ll begin with descriptive statistics. Ask the class if they have heard of descriptive statistics, or ask if they can think of a definition for descriptive statistics. Then, provide the class with the following definition:<p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Descriptive statistics are statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize features of a dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following are descriptive statistics:</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Mean: the average or the norm.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use case: the mean (“average”) age of the students in the class is 13. (what could these data look like?)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Median: the middle value</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use case: the median price for a house is $50K (what could these data look like?)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Mode: the most frequent value</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use case: the mode of number of times individuals went to the library per week is 3</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Range: the highest and lowest values in a dataset</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use case: the range of household income is USD $150K (what could these data look like?)</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Explain to the participants that these descriptive statistics act of measure of centrality and can tell us what is typical in our dataset. For example, ask for volunteers to give their favorite numbers. Write the numbers on the board, if possible, and then walk the participants through finding the mean, median, and mode, and range of the numbers provided.</p>
            <p><b>See Module4_Supplement for an example of how to calculate these statistics within Google Sheets</b></p>
            <p>The next way to make meaning out of your data is to code the data. Ask participants if they have coded data before. Also ask participants if they have an idea what coding is and could provide a definition. Then, provide the following definition:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coding: a process in which data, in both quantitative form (such as questionnaire results) or qualitative (such as interview transcripts) are categorized to make analysis easier. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are several ways coding could be approached. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Iterative Coding (looking for common themes, and patterns in which to group the data)</li>
              <li>Card Sorting - show data columns to stakeholders, develop common understanding of data, and select appropriate data to communicate to public</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="summary">If the above “coding” section is too advanced, there could be a description here that would give more advanced classes the opportunity to go in more depth about iterative coding and card sorting. If a class is less advanced or less familiar with this concept, then the above section can be skipped.</p>

            <h1>Case Study</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <!--<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7500/15717291089_4ddcb34737.jpg" alt="An image of a wall with an ad painted on it for an internet cafe" width="90%"></p>-->

            <p>Provide context for the participants about how decisions made with data can lead to innovative, evidence based practices for organizations and governments.  Take a moment to introduce the following case study to the participants, and provide context.</p> 

            <p>Guiding questions before beginning: How can data be used to solve a problem?</p> 
            <p>Are there any examples of governments using data to make decisions that the participants can think of?</p> 
            <p>What about organizations that use data to make decisions?</p>


            <p>Many countries around the world are using data to make decision on a daily basis, and are seeking ways to solve existing problems using new forms of data.</p> 

            <p>As a prior to beginning the case study, provide context by briefly outlining the case study below in Armenia (adapted from UNDP, A guide to Data Innovation for Development, 2016).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Armenia, Tourism has great potential for growth. Commonly used data sources such as hotel booking logs and border control records are expensive and time-consuming to collect, and only provide part of the picture.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP office in Armenia saw an opportunity to help the tourism industry by using a new form of data collection: understanding tourist preferences by analyzing the number of roaming foreign SIM cards in use.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP team in Armenia used this new form of data collection to track origin and travel patterns for tourists in Armenia, and could then share the data with government decision-makers and local businesses to understand and adapt to shifting tourism trends.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Discussion Questions:</p> 
            <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Armenia was trying to solve? How did they use data collection to solve i How did they use new data to solve the problem? How can they now use that data to make a decision?</p>  

            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Case (MIMU):</p></b>
            <p>Provide context by briefly outlining the case study from Myanmar Information Management Unit’s (MIMU) use of cell phone data and GPS coordinates to create and update baseline data on schools across Myanmar:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Myanmar, smartphones have become increasingly accessible and popular since foreign investors entered the country in 2014. Most individuals now have a smartphone and a data-enabled SIM card.</li>
              <li>MIMU wanted an easier and more accurate way to compile and update baseline data on school locations across Myanmar. Data collection where individuals visit each school and mark the location is time consuming and costly. Accurate and up-to-date baseline data are important to developing more sector-specific data. Information regarding the number and location of schools is also important to help communities identify where available schools are, which schools close, and where more schools are needed. In 2015, MIMU decided to utilize the growth of cell phones and mobile data to facilitate baseline data collection on schools. This was cost effectively, fast, and would allow for data to be collected and updated more frequently.</li>
              <li>They created the “School Location Collector” tool, which collects the GPS location of schools. School officials use the service to get the GPS location and save it to the system’s database. They can then send the GPS coordinates over the internet or by SMS.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>Now, allow each participant the time to read the following case study. On their own, have them write down their answers to the following questions on a sheet of paper:</p> 
              <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Colombia was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it?</p> 
              <p>How can they now use that data for decision making?</p>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p>

            <p>A key piece of using data for decision making is learning how to specify how you would like to use your data as evidence, and what questions you would like to ask your data in order to generate that evidence. This begins with being able to define a problem or need in your organization.</p>

            <p>Defining a problem or challenge that you wish to solve using data can help you space time and resources while you maximize your project returns. With a clearly defined problem, you can build your own capacity to collect only the data that you need to answer your own questions.</p> 

            <p>The Problem definition tool can help identify the key challenge you are trying to address, and to being thinking about what data already exist on the issue. The tool will push you to think specifically about how better measurement or more complete information can help solve the problem. What new decisions will be made? What responses can be faster?</p> 

            <p>As you complete the problem definition tool, you should ask yourself what data you already have surround the problem. You should also think how you can find any existing data about previous projects in the same problem area or around similar data sources. This can spark new ideas for potential data sources for potential data sources for a solution.</p> 

            <p>Before having the participants begin, ask them to think critically about an issue they have in their organization. Then, have the participants work through the problem definition tool provided on the next page (20 mins).</p>

            <p><b>Participant Guide: Problem Definition Tool</b></p> 

            <p>Directions: Use this guide to help you think through a key issue you are trying to address, the factors that contribute to that issue, the people it affects, existing data surrounding the issue, potential sources of new data, and how to use those data to make a decision.</p>
            <ol>

              <li>What is the key issue you want to address and why is it important?</li>  

              <li>What is contributing to the problem? (Guiding questions: What issues surround the problem that key it from being solved? What is the environment of the problem?)</li> 

              <li>Who are the people that are directly affected by the problem?</li> 
 
              <li>Who, if anyone, is currently working on the problem?</li>
 
              <li>What data, relevant to this problem, exist already?</li>
 
              <li>How update are these data? What do they focus on? (Demographics? Geography?)</li> 
 
              <li>How can you use those data to solve your problem?</li>
            </ol>
 
              <p><b>Presentations and Debrief</b> (15 minutes)</p> 

              <p>Ask the participants who would like to volunteer and share what they wrote on their problem definition tool. After each presentation, ask some guiding discussion questions for the participants, such as: What was the problem the participant was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it? How can they now use those data for decision making?</p>

                <h1>Exploring Different Forms of Data</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Explain to the class that data exist in many forms and can be looked at in multiple ways.</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data (the following information has been adapted from MathisFun.com (2014)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between the two types of data. Then, provide the following definitions for each:</p> 

                <p>Qualitative: information that cannot be expresses as a number or quantified. Qualitative data include descriptive data such as your friend’s favorite holiday, the most common given names in your town, or how to describe the smell of a freshly cooked meal.</p> 
 
                <p>Quantitative: information that can be counted or measured.</p> 

                <p>Application: Show the class a picture of this dog (either on screen or a hard copy)</p> 

                <p><img src="https://www.dhbenitez.com/uploads/3/2/1/8/3218271/5236352.png?327" alt="An image of a wall with a dog" width="100%"></p>


                <p>Ask the class how can you use qualitative data to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has long hair, he is brown and black, he is running, etc.)</p> 

                <p>Now ask the class how can you use quantitative information to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has 4 legs, he has two ears, he is running 32 kph</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Primary vs. Secondary Data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between primary and secondary data. Then provide the following definitions for each:<p> 

                <p>Primary: Data that have been collected from an original source for a specific purpose, for example, if a school wanted to know what their students thought of the provided lunch they would question the pupils directly.<p> 

                <p>Secondary: Data that are not originally collected by a group for specific purpose, for example, finding out the average age of a population by using national survey data.</p>

                  <li>
                    <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                    <p>The following are ways that data can be applied. Similar to the format above, pause and ask the class for definitions of each word before providing the definitions in this instructor’s guide.</p> 

                    <p>Dataset: Data selected and arranged in rows and columns. Has the class seen datasets before? What does their datasets look like? How are these datasets stored?</p>  

                    <p>Take time to pass around several sample datasets. In groups of 2-3, have the participants look at each dataset. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p> 

                    <p>Documentation: documents that provide proof or evidence of something, or are a record of something. What are some examples of documentation in the participants’ everyday lives? If the class is quiet, feel free to provide some sample answers (i.e. a passport, birth certificate, proof of residency, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Data visualization: a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.</p> 


                    <p>Pass around example visualized charts or project these images on the screen: </p>

                    <p>For each visualization, ask the class What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p>

                    <p>Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in something. For example, who are the stakeholders in this class? Who are the stakeholders at a restaurant? Who are the stakeholders at a football match? </p>

                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p> 

                    <p>Remind the class that data visualization is a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization.</p> 

                    <p>Pass around this image, or show it on the screen</p>

                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic1.png" alt="An image of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic2.png" alt="A zoom-in of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Only allow each person to look at information for 30 seconds. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p> 

                    <p>Now show the class the same dataset, but visualized:</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic3.png" alt="A map visualization" width="100%"></p>

                    <p>Allow the class 30 seconds once more. Now, have them answer: What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p>

                    <p>Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data are easier than looking at datasets or report. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.</p>

                    <p>Visualizing data allows us to help you or the person using your data easily understand your results and quick pull out information that is relevant to them.</p> 

                    <p>Now ask the class, how would they visualize these data for different stakeholders. How would they visualize it for those working in the employment bureau? What about that work at an NGO? How would the public want to view these data?</p>

                    <p>In this activity, the participants will be broken into groups of 2-3. They will each be given a data visualization. Working together, they should answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the data that were used to make this visualization? It is not provided, so think critically about what information was used to make the chart.</li> 
                      <li>Who is the intended audience, or audiences that could use it?</li>
                      <li>How could they frame these data a different stakeholder? For example, if their answer to the above question was the government, how should these data be visualized for the public?</li> 
                      <li>What problem are these data visualization trying to show?</li> 
                      <li>What information can you gather from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>What conclusions could you make from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>Using the conclusions you made, what are additional questions that you could as about the information provided in the data visualization?</li> 
                      <li>What kinds of decisions could be made from them?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the class is finished, have each group present their findings to class. When the presentations are over, debrief with the participants. You might ask the following questions:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Did you like one visualization more than the other?</li> 
                      <li>How can you use data visualizations to make insightful conclusions?</li>
                      <li>How can you use these conclusions to make decisions?</li> 
                      <li>How can these decisions improving programming within communities or organizations?</li> 
                      <li>What should you consider when visualized data for the public, the government, or an NGO?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It’s important to discuss with that class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>good data visualizations require good data. If the data that underlie a visualization are faulty, the result will be misleading and incorrect conclusions from the visualization.</li> 
                      <li>The processes described in Activity 1.1 of defining a data problem, audience, and goal, are also necessary to take for visualizations. As we move forward throughout this class, we’ll return to these topics. It’s always critically important to remember that for every data project, you need to keep in mind the your audience and what you are trying to accomplish with the data.</li>
                    </ul> 
 
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b></p> 

                    <p>For more advanced classes, use the following questions for participants to answer in their presentations:</p>  

                    <p>What other data could be provided to make this more meaningful?</p>
                    <ul>	
                      <li>Different percentages? Total populations? Other...</li>
                      <li>Why do we want to tell this</li>
                      <li>Is there anything misleading or easily misinterpreted?</li>
                      <li>What other information is necessary for context?</li>
                      <li>What assumptions are made about the graph?</li>
                      <li>Date</li>
                      <li>Comparisons provided matter</li>
                      <li>Data quality/completeness</li>
                      <li>Other</li>
