            <h4>Executive Summary: Data for Decisions Project </h4>
            <p>The overarching goal of the Data for Decision project is to build the capabilities of research organizations, government ministries, and civil society organizations (CSOs) to more effectively use data in their decision-making processes. From data collection and management, to analysis and sharing, the curriculum aims to increase the awareness and use of quality data for evidence-based decision making in tackling social challenges.</p> 

            <p>The key objectives of the Data for Decision-Making course include:<p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic questions to ask of your data and how to define data problems or needs within a community or organization</li>
                <li>Understand how to identify the key players surrounding a difficult problem or social challenge</li> 
                <li>Learn the data life cycle, and understand the importance of data collection, analysis, and sharing</li>
                <li>Understand how to be a consumer of data, and learn new ways to manage and store data so that it can be easily shared among organizations</li>
                <li>Think critically about the vision and mission of your organization, and how to apply innovative solutions that follow that mission using data</li>
                <li>Know what processes to follow and what questions to ask</li> 
                <li>Understanding how to share data resources and solutions amongst different communities and organizations</li>
                <li>Think critically about how to learn from these sharing opportunities</li>
                <li>Building a culture of self-reflection around data, and sharing this culture with other communities and organizations</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>The course is structured into three days spanning six separate modules. Each module has a specific goal and covers a topic designed to bolster ability in using data for decision-making. Modules are structured over a three-hour period, with a ten-minute break in between. Each module contains new information while simultaneously building on previous knowledge from past modules. While following these modules in order can provide the user with a solid foundation in data for decision-making, these modules are meant to stand alone on their own and can be applied in whichever order the user chooses. They can be followed sequentially in order or applied individually based on the user’s specific needs.</p> 

            <p>The organization of each module is as followed:<p> 
            <style type="text/css">

    <td class="tg-h31u">Module 5: Applying Data for Decision Making to Your Organization, Part 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-h31u">Module 6: Applying Data for Decision Making to Your Organization, Part 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

            <p>At the end of this course, participants will have a greater understanding of the role of data not just in their own organization, but also in the world surrounding them. It is our hope that this program can help spark data driven decision-making by spurring understanding, sparking questions, and igniting insights grounded in evidence. The key to any sustainable solution to a problem lies in the use of data for decision-making.</p>
