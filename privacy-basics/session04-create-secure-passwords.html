            <h2>Learning Progression</h2>
            <p>In this lesson, your learners will:</p>
            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>Create strong passwords using the passphrase method.</li>
              <li>Create strong passwords using the 8- and 16-character methods.</li>
              <li>Create strong passwords using the diceware method.</li>
              <li>Test the strength of their newly created passwords.

            </h2>

            <p><strong>Do each part of the lesson on your own</strong> to see how it works.</p>
            
            <p>Make sure learners have a lot of scratch paper or space to generate passwords and pass phrases during the lesson. Also, remind them throughout the lesson that they shouldn't keep any of the passwords or pass phrases they create today since they are making them in a group.</p>
            
            <p>Instead, remind learners to remember the methods they used to make strong passwords and pass phrases today so they can create their own in private.</p>

            <h1>Create a Pass Phrase Inspired by xkcd</h1>
            <div class="time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Visit <a href="http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/">this blog post by Jeff Preshing</a>. Review the comic from xkcd in the post to show your learners how pass phrases work. Explain that pass phrases can be used as secure passwords ebcause they are hard to guess and easy to remember.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://xkcd.com/936/"><img src="images/pass-phrase-xkcd-1.jpg" width="90%" alt="An image of an xkcd web comic explaining how pass phrases compare to less memorable passwords made of letters, numbers, and symbols"></a></p>
            
            <p>A pass phrase is a password made of several common words. Again, <strong><em>the big idea is that pass phrases made of common words are easy to remember, but hard to guess, whereas more complex passwords made of letters, numbers, and symbols are easier to guess and harder to remember.</em></strong></p>
            
            <p>After you remind your learners of that big idea, have them use the <a href="http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/">pass phrase button on the blog post</a> to create 3-5 new pass phrases from the set of 1949 words Preshing used for the site. Ask learners to write down or otherwise record those pass phrases so they can use them later in the activity.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/pass-phrase-maker-1.png" width="75%" alt="An image of a pass phrase and a button that generates new ones on a webpage"></p>
            
            <p>Remind your learners not to use any of these passwords in the future, but to remember that pass phrases are very secure because they are easy for you to remember, but difficult for others to guess.</p>

          </li> <!-- End of step -->
          
          <li>
            <h1>Create a Pass Phrase with Diceware</h1>
            <div class="time">20 minutes</div>

            <p>Next, ask learners to download and open <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc">this Diceware list of words</a> by visiting that link and choosing to save the file to their desktops or document folders. You can shorten the link and post it in a highly visible place in your classroom, or you can paste it into a shared doc, or your can use whatever means of sharing works best for your learners.</p>
            
            <p>Learners can open the file using a program like Notepad (on a PC) or TextEdit (on a Mac).</p>
            
            <p>The file is a huge list of words that correspond to 5-digit numbers. Learners will roll five dice at a time to create a number, reading the dice from left to right to create their own 5-digit numbers.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a roll of 1, 2, 2, 5, and 6 would be read as "12256" and correspond to the word "ankle" in the word list.</p>
            
            <p>Then learners will find the word attached to each of their numbers and repeat the process until they have 4 pass phrases made of 4 words each.</p>
            
            <p>Ask learners to record their Diceware pass phrases along with their xkcd-inspired pass phrases from the last section.</p>
            
            <p>The instructions for generating passwords with Diceware can be found <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">here</a> and are much more privacy-focused than the ones you'll ask your learners to follow in this lesson.</p>
            
            <p>Remind learners not to use the Diceware pass phrases they make in class today, but to use Diceware to create their own pass phrases in private.</p>

          </li> <!-- End of step -->
          
          <li>
            <h1>Create Basic 8 and Basic 16 Passwords</h1>
            <div class="time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Finally, invite learners to create 8- and 16-character passwords made from memorable sentences.</p>
            
            <p>First, have each learner write or otherwise record a sentence that has any combination of 8 words, numbers, and punctuation marks like:
              
            <p><code>Yesterday, I was 5 minutes late.</code></p>
            
            <p>Then ask learners to take the first letter of each word, any punctuation marks, and any numbers to create a password by putting those characters in the same order they have in the sentence. For example, the sentence above would become:</p>
            
            <p><code>Y,Iw5ml!</code></p>
            
            <p> A 16-character password might come from a sentence like this:</p>
            
            <p><code>Last year, I got an A in every class except for the worst 2.</code></p>
            
            <p>And look like this:</p>
            
            <p><code>Ly,IgaAieceftw2.</code></p>
            
            <p>Ask learners to create 2 passwords with 8 characters and 2 passwords with 16 characters using this method. Also ask them to record these passwords with the others they created during the lesson.</p>

          </li> <!-- End of step -->
          
          <li>
            <h1>Test Your Creations</h1>
            <div class="time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Invite your learners to revisit the password meters you used in the Bad Password Collage lesson.  Use any of the following:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li><a href="http://www.passwordmeter.com/">passwordmeter.com</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">howsecureismypassword.net</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.yetanotherpasswordmeter.com/">yetanotherpasswordmeter.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember to post these links in a highly visible place or give them to learners on a shared document or handout, or share them in any way that works best for your learners.</p>
            
            <p>Then, ask your learners to test each of the passwords they made during today's lesson. Have each learner use the same password meter to test each of their passwords for consistency's sake. Ask learners to write down or record each password's score, as well.</p>
            
            <p>Once a learner has tested each of their passwords, they should write down or otherwise record which method created the strongest set of passwords.</p>
            
            <p>Remind learners that they used these methods:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Random pass phrase generation from a list of 1949 words.</li>
              <li>Diceware pass phrase generation.</li>
              <li>Basic-8 and Basic-16 password generation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <p>They should also write down or otherwise record which set of passwords they think were easiest to remember.</p>

          </li> <!-- End of step -->

          <li>
            <h1>Reflection and Assessment</h1>
            <div class="time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Finish the lesson by facilitating a brief, reflective discussion about ways to create secure passwords for learners' online accounts. Use questions like those below or come up with your own. You may collect learners' responses for the purposes of assessment, but be sure to do so using technologies that offer your learners their fullest range of expression.</p>
            
            <p>Also, <strong><em>remind learners one more time not to use any of the passwords they made today</em></strong> as part of your group. They should instead pick a method for creating secure passwords and use it in private to generate passwords for their accounts.</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Which methods seemed strongest to you? Why? What made those passwords so secure?</li>
              <li>Which methods seemed easiest to remember to you? Why?</li>
              <li>In your own words, how might you explain one of our password creation methods to a friend or family member?</li>
              <li>What might some of the weaknesses be of the methods we used today?</li>
              <li>Why might it be important to you to have secure passwords for your accounts? Why should we bother to create strong passwords in the first place?</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>7. <strong>Optional:</strong> Badging</h1>

            <p>You will learn about pronounceable and random passwords using a password generators. You will find out what you can do to create better passwords, and explore different types of passwords to learn about their pros and cons while learning how to <strong>protect</strong> yourself online.</p>

            <p><strong>Steps to complete this task:</strong></p>

            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>Go to <a href="http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/">this xkcd-inspired password generator</a> to create and document four passwords for the purposes of this activity. (Don't ever use the passwords for other purposes. Make your own in private later.)</li>
              <li>Use the <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/125881/privacy-basics/session04-create-secure-passwords.html#step-3">Diceware instructions here</a> to create and document four more passwords.
