        <p>The curriculum was developed in response to the results of a needs assessment conducted by Myanmar’s Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation. The assessment, which spanned multiple government ministries and civil society organizations, indicated an overwhelming desire for tools to support the changing organizational data environments across sectors in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Although there are many data literacy resources available, we found there was not anything that fit the precise needs of organizations in Myanmar. Specifically: 
            <ul>
                <li>A structure designed for environments with nascent/emerging data cultures</li>
                <li>A comprehensive approach that begins with the foundations of assessing organizational data environments and data problems, upon which skills can be built</li>
                <li>Not focused solely on statistical skill building</li>
                <li>Open and customizable</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The key objectives of this course include:  
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic questions to ask of your data and how to define data problems or needs within a community or organization</li>
                <li>Understand how to identify the key data players surrounding a difficult problem or social challenge</li>
                <li>Learn the data life cycle, and understand the importance of data collection, analysis, and sharing</li>
                <li>Understand how to be a more savvy data consumer, and learn new ways to manage and store data so that it can be easily shared among organizations</li>
                <li>Think critically about the vision and mission of your organization, and how to apply innovative solutions that follow that mission using data</li>
                <li>Know what methods to implement and what data collection tools need to be designed to address data gaps</li>
                <li>Understand how to share data resources and solutions amongst different communities and organizations</li>
                <li>Think critically about how to learn from these sharing opportunities</li>
                <li>Build a culture of self-reflection around data, and share this culture with other communities and organizations</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Content Choices</h4>
        <p>Content priorities were developed through findings from the needs assessment and consultation with local organizations. Pilot testing was conducted to obtain feedback on the relative amount of time allocated to different topic areas. Examples and case studies are largely relevant for the Myanmar context and can be replaced with locally relevant materials as needed. Examples of additional modules that could be created include:
            <ul>
                <li>Gender sensitive data approaches</li>
                <li>Ethics and privacy in the data lifecycle</li>
                <li>A module specific for managers</li>
                <li>Program-specific skills (e.g. Excel, R, SPSS, Tableau)</li>
                <li>Proxy indicators</li>
                <li>Basic data and computer literacy</li>
                <li>Basic statistical literacy</li>
                <li>Big data</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>As noted above, the curriculum was designed to be adaptable for new content to be added and topic emphasis shifted based upon new target audiences.</p>
        <h4>Key Organizations</h4>
        <p>The curriculum was developed by the Technology & Social Change Group at the University of Washington Information School, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.mbapf.org/">Myanmar Book Aid and Preservation Foundation</a>.</p>

        <h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>
        <p>Improving ways to create meaningful, locally relevant resources that bring more voices into the decision-making process requires understanding nuance. This work cannot be done well without collaborative insight. If you have any feedback on the curriculum or suggestions, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
