          <h1>Review</h1>
          <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
          <p>Welcome the participants back. Remind the participants of the structure for today: two, three-hour workshops with a break in between for lunch. Also use this time to go over any administrative tasks as necessary.</p>  
          <p>Then, review the following key concepts with the participants. Again, as before, try to have the participants provide their own definitions before</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Data</li>
              <li>Data for decision making</li>
              <li>Stakeholders</li>

              <li>Data producer</li>
              <li>Data consumer</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Ask, what are the key steps to using data for decision making? Remind the participants:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify a problem or research question</li>
              <li>Assess data available to you and your data needs</li>
              <li>Identify stakeholders</li>
              <li>Plan for how data will be used, analyze, and shared</li>
            </ul>
            
          
          <p>Pause to ask if anyone has questions so far.</p>

            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts: Data Lifecycle</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
            <p>Write the word “lifecycle” on the board or project it on the screen. Ask the class what they think the word means. Where have they seen this word before? What kind of examples of lifecycles can they provide? If the class is quiet or slow to respond, feel free to provide some guiding questions, such as what is an example of a lifecycle within their own life? An animal’s life? A plant’s life?</p>
            <p>Tell the class that much like living things, data has a lifecycle of its own.</p>
            <p>Project this image on the screen, or pass it around to participants.</p>
            <p><img src="http://tascha.github.io/D4DM/images/data-lifecycle.jpg" alt="Data Lifecycle Chart: Collect, Analyze, Share" width="100%"></p>
            <p>Then, tell the class that this image represents a data life cycle. There are three stages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collecting data</li>
              <li>Analyzing data</li>
              <li>Sharing data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remind the class that any data lifecycle always begins with a research question or problem that you are trying to solve.</p>
            <p>Then, move on to the following definitions. As before, solicit the class for their own definitions before providing them with the ones below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data collection: data collection is the process of gathering information in a systematic way. Collected data are generally intended to answer questions and/or evaluate outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remind the class that data can be collected from surveys, questionnaires, interviews, or observations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzing data: data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and visualizing data with the goal of discovering its useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. (Wikipedia)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Take time to explain to the participants that data analysis is made up of many stages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Inspecting the data</li>
              <li>Cleaning the data</li>
              <li>Transforming the data</li>
              <li>Visualizing the data (visually)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Introduce the above concepts, but make note that will be explained in detail in the next module. Then, provide the definition for the last part of the data lifecycle: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data sharing: data sharing is the process of making data that are used in problem solving, research, or evaluation available to others. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Underscore to the participants the importance of sharing data. Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues around the world have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered to be key parts of research. In addition to the data themselves, metadata and documentation should also be shared if possible.</p>

            <h1>Providing Context</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <p>Provide context by going through these steps in a country specific example and a generic example.</p>
            <p>Below, two examples have been provided of applications of the data lifecycle. One is a generic example, and one is a country specific example for Myanmar. If implanting this curriculum outside of Myanmar, it would be helpful to provided participants with data lifecycle examples in their own countries.</p>
            <p><b>Generic Example: Digital Green, India</b></p>
            <p>The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in agricultural services is becoming increasingly common. These technologies—which include radio, SMS, television, video, and Internet services—have the potential to help smallholder farmers increase their incomes by making it easier for them to learn about and adopt new farming methods, grow higher-value crops, or connect with new markets.</p>
            <p>Digital Green, an international non-profit organization based in India, uses locally-produced videos and in-person facilitation to share knowledge about improved agricultural and nutrition practices. The program aims to help rural communities across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa understand and adopt better agricultural and nutrition practices, and the ultimate goal of the program is to have a positive impact on individual well-being. Digital Green is currently working in nine states in India, and also in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Tanzania, Malawi, and Papua New Guinea. Since its start in 2008, Digital Green’s program has produced over 4,000 videos reaching more than 800,000 viewers across more than 9,000 villages.</p>
            <p>Digital Green is in the process of measuring the program’s impact on farmer livelihoods and health status using evaluations in both India and Ethiopia and its effect on improving nutrition-related behaviors in India. The organization has also invested in an activity monitoring system that reports data on program implementation and tracks the adoption of Digital Green-promoted practices from remote locations. One challenge in the activity monitoring system is its reliance on data from partner organizations, which varies in quality. Recognizing the issue, Digital Green has instituted a series of data quality checks and procedures to improve quality. The Goldilocks Initiative’s recommendations for Digital Green focus on its agricultural activities, and include refining and consolidating the program’s theory of change and conducting a systematic review of data quality. (<i>Innovations for Poverty Action Lab, 2016</i>)</p>
            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Example: MIMU 3W</b></p>
            <p>In 2008, after Cyclone Nargis, the Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU) launched their 3W project to track and share humanitarian and development activities undertaken by all agencies across Myanmar.</p>
            <p>3W stands for “Who does What, Where.” By keeping an up to date database on which organizations (who) are conducting certain activities (what) in Myanmar (where), other organizations and donors can better target beneficiaries to ensure humanitarian and development needs are met.</p>
            <p>The partnered agencies share their information on planned, ongoing, and recently completed activities every six months using standard sector definitions and MIMU compiles these data. They clean and digitize the data, creating quality baseline data sets on humanitarian and development efforts in Myanmar and on responding agencies in the country. They then make the data publically available for other agencies to use. The intended impact is that agencies and donors can use these data to determine which areas, sectors, and populations to target in their future projects. (<a href="http://themimu.info/3w-maps-and-reports"><i>http://themimu.info/3w-maps-and-reports</i></a>)</p>
            <p>After each example, take time for discussion with the participants regarding data life cycles. Some guiding discussion questions include: What was the problem the organization was trying to solve? How did the organization collect data? How did they plan to analyze data? How will the use data to make a decision? How can the organization share their data? How does the organization question their data quality? Can all the data be shared openly? What kinds of issues need to be considered if data are or are not shared?</p>

            <p>Provide context for the participants about how decisions made with data can lead to innovative, evidence based practices for organizations and governments.  Take a moment to introduce the following case study to the participants, and provide context.</p> 

            <p>Guiding questions before beginning: How can data be used to solve a problem?</p> 
            <p>Are there any examples of governments using data to make decisions that the participants can think of?</p> 
            <p>What about organizations that use data to make decisions?</p>


            <p>Many countries around the world are using data to make decision on a daily basis, and are seeking ways to solve existing problems using new forms of data.</p> 

            <p>As a prior to beginning the case study, provide context by briefly outlining the case study below in Armenia (adapted from UNDP, A guide to Data Innovation for Development, 2016).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Armenia, Tourism has great potential for growth. Commonly used data sources such as hotel booking logs and border control records are expensive and time-consuming to collect, and only provide part of the picture.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP office in Armenia saw an opportunity to help the tourism industry by using a new form of data collection: understanding tourist preferences by analyzing the number of roaming foreign SIM cards in use.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP team in Armenia used this new form of data collection to track origin and travel patterns for tourists in Armenia, and could then share the data with government decision-makers and local businesses to understand and adapt to shifting tourism trends.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Discussion Questions:</p> 
            <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Armenia was trying to solve? How did they use data collection to solve i How did they use new data to solve the problem? How can they now use that data to make a decision?</p>  

            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Case (MIMU):</p></b>
            <p>Provide context by briefly outlining the case study from Myanmar Information Management Unit’s (MIMU) use of cell phone data and GPS coordinates to create and update baseline data on schools across Myanmar:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Myanmar, smartphones have become increasingly accessible and popular since foreign investors entered the country in 2014. Most individuals now have a smartphone and a data-enabled SIM card.</li>
              <li>MIMU wanted an easier and more accurate way to compile and update baseline data on school locations across Myanmar. Data collection where individuals visit each school and mark the location is time consuming and costly. Accurate and up-to-date baseline data are important to developing more sector-specific data. Information regarding the number and location of schools is also important to help communities identify where available schools are, which schools close, and where more schools are needed. In 2015, MIMU decided to utilize the growth of cell phones and mobile data to facilitate baseline data collection on schools. This was cost effectively, fast, and would allow for data to be collected and updated more frequently.</li>
              <li>They created the “School Location Collector” tool, which collects the GPS location of schools. School officials use the service to get the GPS location and save it to the system’s database. They can then send the GPS coordinates over the internet or by SMS.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>Now, allow each participant the time to read the following case study. On their own, have them write down their answers to the following questions on a sheet of paper:</p> 
              <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Colombia was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it?</p> 
              <p>How can they now use that data for decision making?</p>

            <p><i>Adapted from UNDP, A Guide to Data Innovation for Development (2016)</i></p>

            <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn how to address a challenge at your organization by defining a problem that you can use data to solve.</li> 
              <li>Understand how to think through the problem, what types of data may already be available to you, and how you can collect new data to address that problem.</li> 
              <li>Think critically about how to ask the right questions, collect the right data, and how that data can inform the decisions you make at your organization.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p><b>Materials Needed:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Problem definition tool from UNDP, A Guide to Data Innovation for Development (2016)</li>
              <li>Pencils</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p>

            <p>A key piece of using data for decision making is learning how to specify how you would like to use your data as evidence, and what questions you would like to ask your data in order to generate that evidence. This begins with being able to define a problem or need in your organization.</p>

            <p>Defining a problem or challenge that you wish to solve using data can help you space time and resources while you maximize your project returns. With a clearly defined problem, you can build your own capacity to collect only the data that you need to answer your own questions.</p> 

            <p>The Problem definition tool can help identify the key challenge you are trying to address, and to being thinking about what data already exist on the issue. The tool will push you to think specifically about how better measurement or more complete information can help solve the problem. What new decisions will be made? What responses can be faster?</p> 

            <p>As you complete the problem definition tool, you should ask yourself what data you already have surround the problem. You should also think how you can find any existing data about previous projects in the same problem area or around similar data sources. This can spark new ideas for potential data sources for potential data sources for a solution.</p> 

            <p>Before having the participants begin, ask them to think critically about an issue they have in their organization. Then, have the participants work through the problem definition tool provided on the next page (20 mins).</p>

            <p><b>Participant Guide: Problem Definition Tool</b></p> 

            <p>Directions: Use this guide to help you think through a key issue you are trying to address, the factors that contribute to that issue, the people it affects, existing data surrounding the issue, potential sources of new data, and how to use those data to make a decision.</p>
            <ol>

              <li>What is the key issue you want to address and why is it important?</li>  

              <li>What is contributing to the problem? (Guiding questions: What issues surround the problem that key it from being solved? What is the environment of the problem?)</li> 

              <li>Who are the people that are directly affected by the problem?</li> 
 
              <li>Who, if anyone, is currently working on the problem?</li>
 
              <li>What data, relevant to this problem, exist already?</li>
 
              <li>How update are these data? What do they focus on? (Demographics? Geography?)</li> 
 
              <li>How can you use those data to solve your problem?</li>
            </ol>
 
              <p><b>Presentations and Debrief</b> (15 minutes)</p> 

              <p>Ask the participants who would like to volunteer and share what they wrote on their problem definition tool. After each presentation, ask some guiding discussion questions for the participants, such as: What was the problem the participant was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it? How can they now use those data for decision making?</p>

                <h1>Exploring Different Forms of Data</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Explain to the class that data exist in many forms and can be looked at in multiple ways.</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data (the following information has been adapted from MathisFun.com (2014)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between the two types of data. Then, provide the following definitions for each:</p> 

                <p>Qualitative: information that cannot be expresses as a number or quantified. Qualitative data include descriptive data such as your friend’s favorite holiday, the most common given names in your town, or how to describe the smell of a freshly cooked meal.</p> 
 
                <p>Quantitative: information that can be counted or measured.</p> 

                <p>Application: Show the class a picture of this dog (either on screen or a hard copy)</p> 

                <p><img src="https://www.dhbenitez.com/uploads/3/2/1/8/3218271/5236352.png?327" alt="An image of a wall with a dog" width="100%"></p>


                <p>Ask the class how can you use qualitative data to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has long hair, he is brown and black, he is running, etc.)</p> 

                <p>Now ask the class how can you use quantitative information to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has 4 legs, he has two ears, he is running 32 kph</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Primary vs. Secondary Data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between primary and secondary data. Then provide the following definitions for each:<p> 

                <p>Primary: Data that have been collected from an original source for a specific purpose, for example, if a school wanted to know what their students thought of the provided lunch they would question the pupils directly.<p> 

                <p>Secondary: Data that are not originally collected by a group for specific purpose, for example, finding out the average age of a population by using national survey data.</p>

                    <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                    <p>The following are ways that data can be applied. Similar to the format above, pause and ask the class for definitions of each word before providing the definitions in this instructor’s guide.</p> 

                    <p>Dataset: Data selected and arranged in rows and columns. Has the class seen datasets before? What does their datasets look like? How are these datasets stored?</p>  

                    <p>Take time to pass around several sample datasets. In groups of 2-3, have the participants look at each dataset. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p> 

                    <p>Documentation: documents that provide proof or evidence of something, or are a record of something. What are some examples of documentation in the participants’ everyday lives? If the class is quiet, feel free to provide some sample answers (i.e. a passport, birth certificate, proof of residency, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Data visualization: a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.</p> 


                    <p>Pass around example visualized charts or project these images on the screen: </p>

                    <p>For each visualization, ask the class What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p>

                    <p>Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in something. For example, who are the stakeholders in this class? Who are the stakeholders at a restaurant? Who are the stakeholders at a football match? </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p> 

                    <p>Remind the class that data visualization is a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization.</p> 

                    <p>Pass around this image, or show it on the screen</p>

                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic1.png" alt="An image of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic2.png" alt="A zoom-in of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Only allow each person to look at information for 30 seconds. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p> 

                    <p>Now show the class the same dataset, but visualized:</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic3.png" alt="A map visualization" width="100%"></p>

                    <p>Allow the class 30 seconds once more. Now, have them answer: What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p>

                    <p>Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data are easier than looking at datasets or report. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.</p>

                    <p>Visualizing data allows us to help you or the person using your data easily understand your results and quick pull out information that is relevant to them.</p> 

                    <p>Now ask the class, how would they visualize these data for different stakeholders. How would they visualize it for those working in the employment bureau? What about that work at an NGO? How would the public want to view these data?</p>

                    <p>In this activity, the participants will be broken into groups of 2-3. They will each be given a data visualization. Working together, they should answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the data that were used to make this visualization? It is not provided, so think critically about what information was used to make the chart.</li> 
                      <li>Who is the intended audience, or audiences that could use it?</li>
                      <li>How could they frame these data a different stakeholder? For example, if their answer to the above question was the government, how should these data be visualized for the public?</li> 
                      <li>What problem are these data visualization trying to show?</li> 
                      <li>What information can you gather from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>What conclusions could you make from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>Using the conclusions you made, what are additional questions that you could as about the information provided in the data visualization?</li> 
                      <li>What kinds of decisions could be made from them?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the class is finished, have each group present their findings to class. When the presentations are over, debrief with the participants. You might ask the following questions:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Did you like one visualization more than the other?</li> 
                      <li>How can you use data visualizations to make insightful conclusions?</li>
                      <li>How can you use these conclusions to make decisions?</li> 
                      <li>How can these decisions improving programming within communities or organizations?</li> 
                      <li>What should you consider when visualized data for the public, the government, or an NGO?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It’s important to discuss with that class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>good data visualizations require good data. If the data that underlie a visualization are faulty, the result will be misleading and incorrect conclusions from the visualization.</li> 
                      <li>The processes described in Activity 1.1 of defining a data problem, audience, and goal, are also necessary to take for visualizations. As we move forward throughout this class, we’ll return to these topics. It’s always critically important to remember that for every data project, you need to keep in mind the your audience and what you are trying to accomplish with the data.</li>
                    </ul> 
 
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b></p> 

                    <p>For more advanced classes, use the following questions for participants to answer in their presentations:</p>  

                    <p>What other data could be provided to make this more meaningful?</p>
                    <ul>	
                      <li>Different percentages? Total populations? Other...</li>
                      <li>Why do we want to tell this</li>
                      <li>Is there anything misleading or easily misinterpreted?</li>
                      <li>What other information is necessary for context?</li>
                      <li>What assumptions are made about the graph?</li>
                      <li>Date</li>
                      <li>Comparisons provided matter</li>
                      <li>Data quality/completeness</li>
                      <li>Other</li>
                    </ul>
