          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>
          <p>Begin by greeting the class and introducing yourself. Provide time to discuss your background, any experience you have with data, and any other relevant information you wish to share.</p>  

<p>Outline the structure of the day (two modules with a break in between for lunch), and provide time to address any other administrative issues that need to be brought up before class begins.</p> 

<p>Pause to ask if anyone has questions so far.</p>

            <h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>
            <p>Next, introduce the name of the workshop, taking time to write “Data for Decision Making” on the whiteboard (if possible). Underscore the word “data”, or verbally highlight it.</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Ask the class to work with a partner and take a moment and think about what they think of when they hear the word “data”.  Have the class write down 5 words that they associate with data. If they are having trouble thinking of words, feel free to gently guide them by providing a few words: numbers, words, etc. If you provide this information, ask the participants not to use these words as their answers.  (5 minutes) </li>

              <li>Ask for volunteers to report back on what they wrote. If possible, write their answers on the board. What did they write? Did some people write similar answers as others? Do people agree with other people’s answers? Discuss their answers with the class. (5 minutes) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before transitioning, make sure to underscore to the participants that we are going to jump right in and define “data”, “decision making”, and “data for decision making” and then outline course goals and objectives.</p>
 
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

            <p class="summary">Note to instructor: This section comes before describing the workshop to provide context for the workshop.<p> 

            <p>After that the class has shared with each other what they think data are and what they associate data with, offer a formal definition. On the board, write 
            <ul>
              <li>Data: 
                  At its most basic level, data are collections of facts and information. This information can come be packaged as numbers, words, measurements, observations, or descriptions.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>An example:</p> 
            <p>If I didn’t eat breakfast and am hungry, I could ask my colleagues where the best place to get Mohinga is nearby. When I ask that question and receive responses, I collect information. Try to solicit the type of information collected from the class. Is it price? How the breakfast tastes? How close the breakfast place is to the office? How long it will take to eat the breakfast?</p> 

            <p>The information that I collected can be considered data.</p> 


            <p>Questions to ask:</p> 
            <p>Now that data have be re-framed to simply be information, ask the class what kinds of data (information) they collect in their everyday life. If the class is quiet and has not provided a response, feel free to nudge them along with a few more examples, such as do they ask their families about their days when they get home? If they want to buy a new cell phone, do they ask for recommendations?</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Decision Making: 
                After collecting data (information), you are free to make a decision. When you make a decision, you can use the data you collected as evidence to make an informed decision.</li> 
              </ul>
            <p>For instance, in the previous breakfast example, if you hadn’t asked your colleagues for their suggestions for breakfast options, you run the risk of eating a bad breakfast. When you collect data from your colleagues, you can use that information (their response) as a solution to your problem (the fact that you are hungry) in order to make an informed decision that leads to a great breakfast.</p>

            <p>The more people you ask, the more data (information) you have in which to make your decision.</p>  

            <p>Questions to ask:</p>
            <p>Take some time to relate this information back to the participants’ own lives. Ask the class how they’ve used data to make their informed decisions in their own lives. As some guiding questions, ask would they rather have a good breakfast or a poor one? If you want to buy a new cell phone, would you rather take your chances on getting a phone that seems like a great choice, only to realize later it doesn’t suit your needs? Gathering information and using it to make an informed decision is a fact of life that may happen on a daily basis for many people.</p> 

            <p>Once the discussion has finished, Underscore that data are information that is all around us, and that we are all willing or unwilling consumers of data.</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Putting it all together: Data-driven decision-making is the practice of basing decision on the analysis of data rather than using your intuition, guess, or estimate.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Take a moment to ask the class why they think it is important to base decisions on evidence.</p>

            <p>Once finished, relate data-driven decision making back to organizations or local governments, saying that using data to make these decisions allows us to improve programs, respond more effectively to organization and community needs,create solutions to pre-existing problems in organizations or communities, and allows the public to use data to make decisions as well.</p> 


            <p>Take a moment to answer any questions from the participants. Then, transition by mentioning that with this greater context and understand of data for decision making, we can move on to , the goals and outcomes for this workshop.</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Defining Workshop Goals and Outcomes</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Goals:</p> 
            <p>The goal of this 3 day workshop is to equip you with ability to understand issues and resources around data and data collection, and learn the importance of using the data to make an informed, evidence-based decision. This workshop is meant to help you and your organization better understand, use, and manage data for decision making.</p> 


            <p>Outcomes:</p> 
            <p>By then end of this workshop you will be able to:</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Use a basic set of processes and questions to assess the data environment at your own organization.</li> 

              <li>Critically examine data visualization approaches for different audiences.</li> 

              <li>Understand data lifecycle theory, basic skills when working with data, and the resources needed to support working with data.</li>

              <li>Be able to create a data project plan that is specific to your own organization.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Take a moment to walk the participants through the structure of the course. Each day will be structured as two, three hour workshops with a one hour break for lunch in between that focus on addressing key outcomes and goals.<p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Day 1: Introduction to Data for Decision Making (morning), Assessing your own organization's data culture (afternoon)</li>
              <li>Day 2: Building data skills and resources</li>
              <li>Day 3: An applied project using your new skills in which you will use the data available to you to solve a problem or assess a need at your organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pause before moving on and allow time for the participants to ask any clarifying questions.</p> 


          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Case Study</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <!--<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7500/15717291089_4ddcb34737.jpg" alt="An image of a wall with an ad painted on it for an internet cafe" width="90%"></p>-->

            <p>Provide context for the participants about how decisions made with data can lead to innovative, evidence based practices for organizations and governments.  Take a moment to introduce the following case study to the participants, and provide context.</p> 

            <p>Guiding questions before beginning: How can data be used to solve a problem?</p> 
            <p>Are there any examples of governments using data to make decisions that the participants can think of?</p> 
            <p>What about organizations that use data to make decisions?</p>


            <p>Many countries around the world are using data to make decision on a daily basis, and are seeking ways to solve existing problems using new forms of data.</p> 

            <p>As a prior to beginning the case study, provide context by briefly outlining the case study below in Armenia (adapted from UNDP, A guide to Data Innovation for Development, 2016).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Armenia, Tourism has great potential for growth. Commonly used data sources such as hotel booking logs and border control records are expensive and time-consuming to collect, and only provide part of the picture.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP office in Armenia saw an opportunity to help the tourism industry by using a new form of data collection: understanding tourist preferences by analyzing the number of roaming foreign SIM cards in use.</li> 
              <li>The UNDP team in Armenia used this new form of data collection to track origin and travel patterns for tourists in Armenia, and could then share the data with government decision-makers and local businesses to understand and adapt to shifting tourism trends.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Discussion Questions:</p> 
            <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Armenia was trying to solve? How did they use data collection to solve i How did they use new data to solve the problem? How can they now use that data to make a decision?</p>  

            <p><b>Myanmar Specific Case (MIMU):</p></b>
            <p>Provide context by briefly outlining the case study from Myanmar Information Management Unit’s (MIMU) use of cell phone data and GPS coordinates to create and update baseline data on schools across Myanmar:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Myanmar, smartphones have become increasingly accessible and popular since foreign investors entered the country in 2014. Most individuals now have a smartphone and a data-enabled SIM card.</li>
              <li>MIMU wanted an easier and more accurate way to compile and update baseline data on school locations across Myanmar. Data collection where individuals visit each school and mark the location is time consuming and costly. Accurate and up-to-date baseline data are important to developing more sector-specific data. Information regarding the number and location of schools is also important to help communities identify where available schools are, which schools close, and where more schools are needed. In 2015, MIMU decided to utilize the growth of cell phones and mobile data to facilitate baseline data collection on schools. This was cost effectively, fast, and would allow for data to be collected and updated more frequently.</li>
              <li>They created the “School Location Collector” tool, which collects the GPS location of schools. School officials use the service to get the GPS location and save it to the system’s database. They can then send the GPS coordinates over the internet or by SMS.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>Now, allow each participant the time to read the following case study. On their own, have them write down their answers to the following questions on a sheet of paper:</p> 
              <p>What was the problem the UNDP in Colombia was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it?</p> 
              <p>How can they now use that data for decision making?</p>

            <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn how to address a challenge at your organization by defining a problem that you can use data to solve.</li> 
              <li>Understand how to think through the problem, what types of data may already be available to you, and how you can collect new data to address that problem.</li> 
              <li>Think critically about how to ask the right questions, collect the right data, and how that data can inform the decisions you make at your organization.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p><b>Materials Needed:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Problem definition tool from UNDP, A Guide to Data Innovation for Development (2016)</li>

            </ul>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p>

            <p>A key piece of using data for decision making is learning how to specify how you would like to use your data as evidence, and what questions you would like to ask your data in order to generate that evidence. This begins with being able to define a problem or need in your organization.</p>

            <p>Defining a problem or challenge that you wish to solve using data can help you space time and resources while you maximize your project returns. With a clearly defined problem, you can build your own capacity to collect only the data that you need to answer your own questions.</p> 

            <p>The Problem definition tool can help identify the key challenge you are trying to address, and to being thinking about what data already exist on the issue. The tool will push you to think specifically about how better measurement or more complete information can help solve the problem. What new decisions will be made? What responses can be faster?</p> 

            <p>As you complete the problem definition tool, you should ask yourself what data you already have surround the problem. You should also think how you can find any existing data about previous projects in the same problem area or around similar data sources. This can spark new ideas for potential data sources for potential data sources for a solution.</p> 

            <p>Before having the participants begin, ask them to think critically about an issue they have in their organization. Then, have the participants work through the problem definition tool provided on the next page (20 mins).</p>

            <p><b>Participant Guide: Problem Definition Tool</b></p> 

            <p>Directions: Use this guide to help you think through a key issue you are trying to address, the factors that contribute to that issue, the people it affects, existing data surrounding the issue, potential sources of new data, and how to use those data to make a decision.</p>
            <ol>

              <li>What is the key issue you want to address and why is it important?</li>  

              <li>What is contributing to the problem? (Guiding questions: What issues surround the problem that key it from being solved? What is the environment of the problem?)</li> 

              <li>Who are the people that are directly affected by the problem?</li> 
 
              <li>Who, if anyone, is currently working on the problem?</li>
 
              <li>What data, relevant to this problem, exist already?</li>
 
              <li>How update are these data? What do they focus on? (Demographics? Geography?)</li> 
 
              <li>How can you use those data to solve your problem?</li>
            </ol>
 
              <p><b>Presentations and Debrief</b> (15 minutes)</p> 

              <p>Ask the participants who would like to volunteer and share what they wrote on their problem definition tool. After each presentation, ask some guiding discussion questions for the participants, such as: What was the problem the participant was trying to solve? How did they use new forms of data collection to solve it? How can they now use those data for decision making?</p>

                <h1>Exploring Different Forms of Data</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Explain to the class that data exist in many forms and can be looked at in multiple ways.</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data (the following information has been adapted from MathisFun.com (2014)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between the two types of data. Then, provide the following definitions for each:</p> 

                <p>Qualitative: information that cannot be expresses as a number or quantified. Qualitative data include descriptive data such as your friend’s favorite holiday, the most common given names in your town, or how to describe the smell of a freshly cooked meal.</p> 
 
                <p>Quantitative: information that can be counted or measured.</p> 

                <p>Application: Show the class a picture of this dog (either on screen or a hard copy)</p> 

                <p><img src="https://www.dhbenitez.com/uploads/3/2/1/8/3218271/5236352.png?327" alt="An image of a wall with a dog" width="100%"></p>


                <p>Ask the class how can you use qualitative data to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has long hair, he is brown and black, he is running, etc.)</p> 

                <p>Now ask the class how can you use quantitative information to provide information about the dog? (For example, he has 4 legs, he has two ears, he is running 32 kph</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Primary vs. Secondary Data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask the class if they know the difference between primary and secondary data. Then provide the following definitions for each:<p> 

                <p>Primary: Data that have been collected from an original source for a specific purpose, for example, if a school wanted to know what their students thought of the provided lunch they would question the pupils directly.<p> 

                <p>Secondary: Data that are not originally collected by a group for specific purpose, for example, finding out the average age of a population by using national survey data.</p>

                    <h1>Introducing Key Concepts</h1>
                    <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                    <p>The following are ways that data can be applied. Similar to the format above, pause and ask the class for definitions of each word before providing the definitions in this instructor’s guide.</p> 

                    <p>Dataset: Data selected and arranged in rows and columns. Has the class seen datasets before? What does their datasets look like? How are these datasets stored?</p>  

                    <p>Take time to pass around several sample datasets. In groups of 2-3, have the participants look at each dataset. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p> 

                    <p>Documentation: documents that provide proof or evidence of something, or are a record of something. What are some examples of documentation in the participants’ everyday lives? If the class is quiet, feel free to provide some sample answers (i.e. a passport, birth certificate, proof of residency, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Data visualization: a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.</p> 


                    <p>Pass around example visualized charts or project these images on the screen: </p>

                    <p>For each visualization, ask the class What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for?</p>

                    <p>Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in something. For example, who are the stakeholders in this class? Who are the stakeholders at a restaurant? Who are the stakeholders at a football match? </p>

                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> (Use the following information to introduce and explain the activity to the class)</p> 

                    <p>Remind the class that data visualization is a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing them in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization.</p> 

                    <p>Pass around this image, or show it on the screen</p>

                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic1.png" alt="An image of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic2.png" alt="A zoom-in of a spreadsheet" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Only allow each person to look at information for 30 seconds. What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p> 

                    <p>Now show the class the same dataset, but visualized:</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="../D4DM/images/activity1.2pic3.png" alt="A map visualization" width="100%"></p>

                    <p>Allow the class 30 seconds once more. Now, have them answer: What information is provided? Is it qualitative or quantitative? What does this information show? Who can use it/what is it for? The participants may not have complete answers to this.</p>

                    <p>Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data are easier than looking at datasets or report. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.</p>

                    <p>Visualizing data allows us to help you or the person using your data easily understand your results and quick pull out information that is relevant to them.</p> 

                    <p>Now ask the class, how would they visualize these data for different stakeholders. How would they visualize it for those working in the employment bureau? What about that work at an NGO? How would the public want to view these data?</p>

                    <p>In this activity, the participants will be broken into groups of 2-3. They will each be given a data visualization. Working together, they should answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the data that were used to make this visualization? It is not provided, so think critically about what information was used to make the chart.</li> 
                      <li>Who is the intended audience, or audiences that could use it?</li>
                      <li>How could they frame these data a different stakeholder? For example, if their answer to the above question was the government, how should these data be visualized for the public?</li> 
                      <li>What problem are these data visualization trying to show?</li> 
                      <li>What information can you gather from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>What conclusions could you make from the visualization?</li>
                      <li>Using the conclusions you made, what are additional questions that you could as about the information provided in the data visualization?</li> 
                      <li>What kinds of decisions could be made from them?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the class is finished, have each group present their findings to class. When the presentations are over, debrief with the participants. You might ask the following questions:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Did you like one visualization more than the other?</li> 
                      <li>How can you use data visualizations to make insightful conclusions?</li>
                      <li>How can you use these conclusions to make decisions?</li> 
                      <li>How can these decisions improving programming within communities or organizations?</li> 
                      <li>What should you consider when visualized data for the public, the government, or an NGO?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It’s important to discuss with that class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>good data visualizations require good data. If the data that underlie a visualization are faulty, the result will be misleading and incorrect conclusions from the visualization.</li> 
                      <li>The processes described in Activity 1.1 of defining a data problem, audience, and goal, are also necessary to take for visualizations. As we move forward throughout this class, we’ll return to these topics. It’s always critically important to remember that for every data project, you need to keep in mind the your audience and what you are trying to accomplish with the data.</li>
                    </ul> 
 
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b></p> 

                    <p>For more advanced classes, use the following questions for participants to answer in their presentations:</p>  

                    <p>What other data could be provided to make this more meaningful?</p>
                    <ul>	
                      <li>Different percentages? Total populations? Other...</li>
                      <li>Why do we want to tell this</li>
                      <li>Is there anything misleading or easily misinterpreted?</li>
                      <li>What other information is necessary for context?</li>
                      <li>What assumptions are made about the graph?</li>
                      <li>Date</li>
                      <li>Comparisons provided matter</li>
                      <li>Data quality/completeness</li>
                      <li>Other</li>
