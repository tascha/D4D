            <h2>Data for Decision-Making Curriculum</h2>
            <p>The overarching goal of the Data for Decision-Making (D4D) curriculum is to build the capabilities of research organizations, government ministries, and civil society organizations to more effectively collect, use, and share data in their organizations and apply data in their decision-making processes. Through basic organizational data environment assessment, understanding each stage of the data lifecycle, and tools to develop a data project plan, the curriculum aims to increase the awareness and use of quality data for evidence-based decision-making and in tackling social challenges.</p> 
            <p>We designed this curriculum in response to a needs assessment conducted by partners in Myanmar. Although there are many data literacy resources available, there was nothing that fit the precise needs of organizations there, who indicated an overwhelming desire for tools to support the changing organizational data environments across sectors in their country. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A structure designed for environments with nascent/emerging data cultures</li>
                <li>A comprehensive approach that begins with the foundations of assessing organizational data environments and data problems, upon which skills can be built</li>
                <li>Not focused solely on statistical skill building</li>
                <li>Open and customizable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We see these as needs not unique to Myanmar and have structured the curriculum to be adapted and expanded to fit the contexts of other places.</p>
